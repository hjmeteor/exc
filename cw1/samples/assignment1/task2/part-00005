ACTIONSCRIPT AND JAVASCRIPT ARE IMPLEMENTATION OF FACT ACTIOSCRIPT IS A BETTER IMPLEMENTATION OF ECMASCRIPT AND ITS OBJECT ORIENTED WITH JAVASCRIPT IS THAT IT IS RENDERED BY BROWSER ENGINE AND EACH BROWSER USES A DIFFERENT ENGINE SO THE PROBLEM OF BROWSER COMPATIBILITY IS ALWAYS THERE IN ACTIONSCRIPT RUNS ON FLASH PLAYER IT GIVES A UNIFORM PERFORMANCE IN EVERY CAN BE EASILY REPLACED BY FLEX AND BOTH ARE QUITE INFACT ACTIONSCRIPT IS VERY EASY TO LEARN COMPARE TO

ACTUALLY THINK THAT JAVASCRIPT IS ONE OF THE BEST LANGUAGES TO START PROGRAMMING WHEN YOU YOU REALLY GET IT AND YOU WANT TO GO C IS SOMETHING GREAT TO IT GIVES YOU A MUCH DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW COMPUTERS REALLY REALLY LETS YOU GET STARTED SEE IMMEDIATE AND RAMP UP TO MORE COMPLEX CONCEPTS VERY REST OF MY ANSWER ASSUMES YOU KNOW PRACTICALLY NOTHING ABOUT PROGRAMMING WEB OR MAYBE YOU KNOW A LITTLE HTML UP A TEXT YOU CAN EVEN JUST START WITH NOTEPAD OR AND PUT IN THE THE FILE AS AND OPEN IT IN A WRITTEN A GET EASIER THAN NO NEED TO GET INTO THE COMMAND LINE OR DOWNLOAD OR BUILD I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST STARTED BEING FRUSTRATED TRYING TO GET PHP RUNNING ON MY MACHINE AND WISHING IT WAS AS SIMPLE AS GETTING STARTED WITH NEXT STEP IS JUST TO READ AND DOCUMENTATION IS FREELY AVAILABLE ALL OVER FOR LEARNING I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANYTHING FROM AND DEFINITIVE PRETTY GOOD BASIC PROJECT WOULD BE A CALCULATOR BUT LOTS OF FUN THINGS YOU CAN WHEN GOTTEN YOUR FEET AND YOU FEEL A LITTLE MORE EXPLORE SOME OTHER RUBY IS A PRETTY GOOD STEP FROM BY THAT POINT PROBABLY KNOW WHERE TO GO YOU MAY NEVER TAKE THE ROAD TO LEARNING EVEN IF YOU LEARN YOU WILL LIKELY NEVER REALLY HAVE TO USE	
ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD THERE ARE A FEW WAYS OF LOOKING AT THIS COULD BE SEEN NEGATIVELY FOR ONE ONE THING YOU CAN DO IN A NORMAL INTERVIEW TO SORT THE WHEAT FROM THE CHAFF IS ASK THEM WHAT THEY KNOW ABOUT YOUR COMPANY AND THE GOOD THAT ARE KEEN TO WORK FOR YOU AND GENERALLY EAGER AND HAVE LOOKED YOU UP AND AT LEAST GONE TO YOUR WEBSITE YOU HAVE AND FOUND OUT WHAT IT IS YOU SO BY ASKING THEM THIS UPFRONT YOU ARE LOSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HOW MUCH INITIATIVE THEY OF COURSE YOU MAKE UP FOR THIS IN OTHER AREAS EG BY ASKING QUESTIONS THAT A REASONABLE PERSON MAY HAVE LOOKED UP OTHER POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IS THAT IT CAN OFTEN BE HARD TO UNDERSTAND AN A BUSINESS OR A PRODUCT FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKING I WORKED IN FOR AND NOT UNTIL YOU GET TO A PLACE LIKE THAT THAT YOU CAN SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT TEAMS NEW CALL CENTRE AND SO AND GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY DO AND WHY THEY DO UNDERSTADNING THE CULTURE IS ALSO HARD WITHOUT BEING A PART OF BRANN IS RIGHT IN THAT YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO IS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING IT RATHER THAN SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY YOU MIGHT BE EXCLUDING GOOD POTENTIAL HIRES WHO WILL PICK UP YOUR BUSINESS QUITE BEING I LIKE WHERE GOING WITH THE FORCING A CANDIDATE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT IS A GOOD PERHAPS YOU COULD NARROW THE FOCUS TO A SINGLE ASPECT OF YOUR WHICH IS MORE DIGESTABLE IN A TYPICALLY THIS WILL ALSO ALLOW YOU TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HOW MUCH INITATIVE THEY TOOK BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE ORIGINAL	
ACTUALLY YOUR ERROR SHOULD BE ON THE SECOND NOT THE AND SHOULD BE BECAUSE YOU USED IT BEFORE YOU INITIALIZED COMPILER IS HELPING YOU INITIALIZE THEM AS A INSTEAD LET THE COMPILER HELP YOU NICE THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT WILL PATH CHECK FOR IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH STATEMENT WITH 3 CASES WHERE EACH SETS THE VALUE BUT YOU FORGET TO SET IT IN YOUR BUT USE IT AFTERWARDS IT WILL WARN YOU THAT YOU MISSED A YOU INITIALIZE VARIABLES TO YOU TAKE THAT BENEFIT

ADDITION TO WHAT OTHERS HAVE ALREADY THERE ARE ALSO BENEFITS SPECIFIC TO USING CLOUD SERVICES BY COMPANIES LIKE WHAT SOME MIGHT IS NOT INHERENTLY IN MOST QUITE THE OPPOSITE THIS IS BECAUSE MOST COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF RELIABILITY AND REDUNDANCY THAT LIKE MICROSOFT OR AMAZON UNLESS YOU ARE HOSTING SOURCE CODE FOR A DEFENSE PROJECT OR OTHER PROJECTS WHERE THE THREAT OF ESPIONAGE IS VERY THE GREATEST THREATS TO YOUR CODE AND YOUR BUSINESS ARE MORE MUNDANE THINGS LIKE CLOUD SERVICES PROVIDE LEVELS OF REDUNDANCY THAT MOST BUSINESSES SIMPLY CANNOT OBTAIN ON THEIR THIS INCLUDES DATA REDUNDANCY HARDWARE REDUNDANCY AND GEOGRAPHICAL REDUNDANCY SERVER LOCATIONS ACROSS THE IF A NATURAL DISASTER HITS YOUR IS YOUR DATA GOING TO BE EACH SMALL BUSINESS BY ITSELF CANNOT AFFORD SUPPORT STAFF AND DOLLAR BUT POOLING THEIR RESOURCES TOGETHER THROUGH A CLOUD SERVICE AFFORDS THEM CENTRALIZATION AND BETTER RESOURCE ACCESS TO A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF RELATED TO BY CENTRALIZING THE DATA OF THOUSANDS OF THIS ALLOWS SECURITY RESOURCES TO BE MUCH MORE TIGHTLY IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MOST COMMERCIAL HOSTING PROVIDERS OFFER AND DEDICATED AND EVEN CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO CONFIGURE THEIR HOWEVER THEY AND WHATEVER APPLICATIONS ON IT THEY SO YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT DEAL MORE FREEDOM THAN THAT OFFERED BY WEB	
ADDITION TO WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID ABOUT MULTITHREADING THIS ALSO WANT TO READ THE CHILD PROCESS ERROR I BELIEVE THAT SOME IF YOU DRAIN THE ERROR STREAM FOR THE PROCESS IT COULD CAUSE IT TO	
ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITY SPECIFIC TO A GROUP OF USERS REALLY ELABORATE DATABASE ACCESS I MIGHT MAKE THOSE METHODS STATIC ON THE USER	
ADDRESS THE ISSUE BY HAVING A SUBSET OF TESTS THAT TAKE 1 MINUTE OR LESS THAT BE RUN BEFORE THEN RUN THE FULL SET OF TESTS FROM YOUR CI YOUR FULL SET OF TESTS TAKES 15 MINUTES THEN LOOK TO DIVIDE THEM AND RUN THEM IN YOU CAN USE THE TO RUN THE TESTS MOST INTERESTED IN THEN THE SMOKE TESTS PRIOR TO AND HAVE THE REST RUN FROM THE CI

AHEAD WITH USE A LOT OF FOR THE MARK USE A REPEATER CONTROL WITH ALL CLEAN HTML MARK UP OF SERVER SIDE CONTROLS WHICH WOULD GENERATE A LOT OF UNNECESSARY MARK UP QUICKLY CREATING PERFORMANCE POPULATE X NUMBER OF ITEMS ON INITIAL AND THEN USING JQUERY PULL DATA AS REQUIRED BASED ON USER YOU CAN SERVE THIS DATA VIA DECODE JSON ON CLIENT SIDE USING JQUERY AND PERFORM A LOOP WHICH CONVERTS THIS JSON INTO APPROPRIATE HTML AND INJECTS IT INTO THE CORRECT HTML BE SIMPLE	
AJAX IS USED FOR REFRESH THERE BY ELIMINATING THE COMPLETE PAGE THERE ARE 2 MAIN TRANSFER DATA TRANSFER AND FROM THE IS LESS COMPARED TO THE ENTIRE PAGE USER EXPERIENCE SINCE THE USER WILL NOT BE SEEING A BLANK PAGE IT GIVES THE USER AN ILLUSION OF INTERACTING WITH THE CAN BE DONE USING AJAX IS AN EVER ENDING GMAIL USES AJAX FOR IT IF YOU ARE USING GMAIL AND COMPARE IT WITH OTHER EMAIL PROVIDERS YOU WILL KNOW THE HAS RICH AJAX FEATURES IN ITS USES AJAX FOR THINK WHAT AJAX CANNOT DO WILL BE EASIER TO FOR EXAMPLE WEB BROWSERS CANNOT MAINTAIN THE VIEW STATE OF THE AJAX ENABLED AJAX ENABLED WEBSITES DO NOT RENDER PROPERLY IN MOBILE

ALL ABOUT THE BUT IT GET SET TILL OR SOMETHING HIGHER IN THE OBJECT HEIRARCHY THE CALLS	
ALL BUT THE SHORTEST USE THE BRACES AND SPACE THEM YOU WANT TO DO THIS FOR A FEW HARDER TO MAKE A MISTAKE ABOUT WHERE SOMETHING EASIER TO LANGUAGES WITH FACILITIES FAILURE TO INCLUDE BRACES WILL CAUSE CONFUSING LOGIC ERRORS WHEN A MACRO CONTAINING MULTIPLE STATEMENTS IS EXPANDED INSIDE OF AN UNBRACED	
ALL DEPENDS ON KIND OF PROJECT I AM WORKING UPON THE PROJECT IS NEW THEN WE DO HAVE A PHASE CALLED BUG FIXING AFTER THE TESTING MOST OF THE BUGS GET FIXED THE PROJECT IS MAINTAINANCE PROJECT THEN FIXING BUGS IS A DAILY	
ALL DEPENDS ON WHICH JQUERY VERSION YOU COULD USE MAYBE ADDING THAN YOU SHOULD ENTER THE ATTRIBUTE VALUE THE SAME AS DEFINED IN THE MARKUP IF TRYING TO FIND AN IMAGE WITH DO THIS BECAUSE IT IT WILL BE TRYING TO FIND IMAGES WITH SRC TO NOT CONTAINING YOU WANT TO SEARCH ATTRIBUTES DEFINING ONLY PARTS OF SUGGEST READING THE API FOR TO GET ALL IMAGES WHIT SRC YOU COULD YOU CAN FIND ELEMENTS WHOSE ATTRIBUTES START OR END WITH SPECIFIC VALUES	
ALL ELSE FAILS YOU COULD STORE IT AS AN INTEGER VALUE OF SECONDS FROM A POINT IN THIS WOULD ALLOW YOU TO COMPARE IT AGAINST OTHER DATES STORED THE SAME WAY WITHOUT	
ALL ELSE YOU COULD ALWAYS WRITE THE MAIL TO A FILE AND TRY USING TO INVOKE MAIL	
ALL FOR THE AND SORRY FOR THE DUPLICATE I DID NOT FIND THE DUPLICATE WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR IT BECAUSE I DID NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT SEARCH TERMS TO I HAVE MY PROBLEM SOLVED THANKS TO THE PHP TRANSLATION OF THE CODE USED BY I MADE ONE TINY CHANGE IN CALCULATING THE I AM STORING MY DATES IN MYSQL AS TIMESTAMP IN THE GMT I HAVE TO USE THE SAME FOR CALCULATING THE CURRENT THIS MAKES FOR A TIMEZONE NEUTRAL WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT IS NEEDED IN MY	
ALL GIVE YOU A LOT OF DATA TO PLAY ALL FOR ALSO A LOT OF TEXTUAL DATA AVAILABLE THROUGH INITIATIVES LIKE PROJECT AND IT IS JUST THE TIP OF THE HAVE BEEN WONDERING HOW YOU COULD USE THIS DATA FOR A FIRST YEAR IT SO I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF MACHINE COLLABORATIVE FILTERING MY INTEREST IN THIS AREA WAS PIQUED BY THE BOOK COLLECTIVE BY TOBY AND NOW I WANT TO TAKE A DEEPER LOOK AT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH I KNOW WHERE TO ANY HAVE ALSO BEEN PONDERING WHETHER I SHOULD GO AND BUY SOMETHING LIKE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS IT WORTH THE TRIP ACROSS THE ARE SOME WAYS TO HAVE FUN WITH A LARGE AMOUNT OF THE	
ALL I HAVE A BUTTON ON CLICK OF WHICH I WANT TO GO ONE STEP BACK USING FOR THIS I AM USING ALTHOUGH THIS WORKS FINE IN IE7 AND FIREFOX IT IS NOT WORKING IN IE6 AND THERE IS NO CHANGE AS THE USER STAYS ON THE SAME M ATTACHING THE EVENT TO NOT	
ALL KEYS WHOSE VALUE IS K IN MAKES A LIST OF THE KEYS AND OVER THE NOT OVER THE IF DEL	
ALL KNOW THAT WE CAN USE EXCEPTION WRAPPING CATCH IT LATER WHERE WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT IS DISTINGUISHING THE TYPES OF ERRORS AFTER THE STORED PROC IS HAVE FIELD WHERE STORED PROC DUMPS ITS IT COULD BE VALIDATION VALIDATING AGAINST DB BE OR AUTHORIZATION ERROR DO THAT IN 2 ONE OF WHICH IS OR A SQL SHORT I NEED A PRETTY AND ELEGANT MECHANISM TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TYPE OF ERROR BEFORE THROWING AN APPROACHES I THOUGHT THE DATABASE LEVEL HAVE 3 ERROR 1 FOR 1 FOR SQL ERROR AND 1 FOR ANY OTHER THIS COULD GET AN ERROR STRUCT WHERE ERROR MESSAGES ARE STORED AND LATER CAN BE COMPARED TOO WHAT IF A ERROR MESSAGE IN DB HARD TO OTHER HANDLING	
ALL MAJOR DESKTOP BROWSERS SUPPORT SO DO MANY MOBILE INCLUDING OPERA AND SAFARI ON THE THE ONLY MAJOR BROWSER I KNOW OF THAT SUPPORT IFRAMES IS THE BLACKBERRY OBJECT TAG IS SUPPORTED BY MOST BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION IS EXTREMELY INCONSISTENT ACROSS THE VARIOUS WRONG WITH JUST HAVING A FLAT PAGE WITH AN ORDINARY NAVIGATION IF YOU ARE ONLY DISPLAYING ONE PAGE AT A AND THE ONLY INTERFACE ELEMENT BEING PLACED OUTSIDE OF THE IFRAME IS A TAB THEN WHY NOT JUST INTEGRATE THE TABS INTO THE PAGE LAYOUT AND DO AWAY WITH THE OF ANY SORT TEND TO BREAK THE FAMILIAR BROWSER BEHAVIORS THAT PEOPLE ARE THE FORWARD AND BACK NAVIGATION AND THEY COMPLETELY DISABLE THE USE OF WHEN BUILDING A YOU SHOULD TRY NOT TO RESTRICT OR DICTATE TO VISITORS HOW ALLOWED TO BROWSE YOUR IF THE USER WANTS TO OPEN A LINK A NEW THEY SHOULD NOT BE LEFT WITHOUT A NAVIGATION IF THEY MAKE THEIR BROWSER WINDOW A PARTICULAR THE PAGE CONTENT SHOULD FILL THAT NOT A PREDETERMINED AREA SPECIFIED BY THE DIMENSIONS OF THE ARE INHERENTLY MAKES THEM WHICH IS WHY SO FEW PROFESSIONAL WEBSITES USE CHEAP BROADBAND IS WIDESPREAD ENOUGH THESE DAYS THAT RELOADING A FEW EXTRA KILOBYTES OF NAVIGATIONAL DATA MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO THE OVERALL USER	
ALL OF THE FORMATTED EXTRACTION OPERATIONS OF SKIP OVER WHITESPACE EXTRACTING AN ITEM ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO PART WAYS WITH THIS THEN YOU COULD PROBABLY ACHIEVE WHAT YOU WANT BY DERIVING A NEW FROM AND OVERRIDING EACH TO CALL THE FOLLOWING METHOD AT THE CHAR SKIPS OVER WHITESPACE TO READ A IF NOT AT END OF FILE AND NO ERRORS QUITE A BIT OF LEAVING OUT A FEW DETAILS HERE AS THE FACT THAT A MORE GENERAL SOLUTION WOULD BE TO OVERRIDE THE CLASS TEMPLATE	
ALL OF THE FREE PROJECT TOOLS FOR METHODOLOGIES OUT THERE DO MODEL USER SUCH AS FOR AND SO AND PERHAPS BUT THAT IS NOT DOES MEAN SOMETHING ELSE IN YOUR OTHER THAN SHORT PIECES OF	
ALL REFERENCES AND SUDDENLY IE DECIDES TO PLAY EVEN THE BRAND NEW VERSION IS YEARS BEHIND THE OTHER 3	
ALL ROOMS ARE AVAILABLE FOR 24 HOURS A 7 DAYS A WEEK THEN YOUR RESERVATION SHOULD HAVE A AND RATHER THAN JUST THE STANDARD RESERVATION LIKELY HAS A SPECIFIC START TIME AND ENDING BUT YOU MAY WANT TO BE SPECIFIC IN ORDER TO OFFER EARLY ARRIVALS OR LATE IS THE LOGIC PICKS DATE AND PROGRAM GRABS 6PM OF CHECK IN DATE AND 11AM OF CHECKOUT DATE AND SELECTS THE ROOMS ARE NOT BOOKED WITHIN THOSE TIMES BASED ON THE CURRENT SOUNDS LIKE A FAIRLY SIMPLE APPROACH BUT YOU MAY NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR MAID SPLITTING UP THE RESERVATION BETWEEN ROOMS ON	
ALL THE BROWSERS HAVE THERE OWN JAVASCRIPT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THE SAME API THEY PROVIDE FOR ACCESSING THE JAVASCRIPT TO COMPLETE YOUR YOU HAVE DRAGONFLY FOR AND WEBINSPECTOR FOR THE BROWSERS BASED ON WEBKIT	
ALL THE OTHER REASONS ALREADY KEEP ALSO IN MIND THE A CLASS CAN EASILY IMPLEMENT SEVERAL WHICH CONSTRUCTOR SHOULD BE USED	
ALL THERE IS NO REASON TO DO ANYTHING LIKE YOU HAVE TO DO IS CHECK EACH TIME SOMEONE CALLS THE YOU KEEP TRACK OF THE DATE AND WHEN THE CURRENT DATE NO LONGER MATCHES YOUR VARIABLE THEN YOU FIRE OFF THE THING THAT GETS NEW OF COURSE NOT VERY SCALABLE BUT FINE FOR A SMALL	
ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT DEFERRED SEEMS THAT THIS IS A FEATURE OF HTML SO NOT NECESSARILY FROM THE BUT WITH THE ONLOAD EVENT DOING PRETTY MUCH WHAT THE DEFERRED OPTION NOT SURE A HUGE DEMAND FOR	
ALL THREE COLUMNS AS PRIMARY	
ALL VALUES ARE UPDATED AT WHY REPRODUCE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT IS I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE DIFFERENT TABLES FOR SERIAL AND EACH OF THOSE TABLES WILL ALSO HAVE THE PRODUCT ID AND THE UPDATED YOU COULD ALSO EASILY TELL WHICH PART OF THE PRODUCT HAS YOU WOULD HAVE THE COMPARE ALL THE FIELDS OF THE PRODUCT WITH ALL THE FIELDS OF THE PRODUCT THAT WAS SAVED JUST BEFORE THE FIRST	
ALL YOUR OWN NEW METHODS IN A NEW AND CREATE A CLASS WHICH IMPLEMENTS THIS INTERFACE IT WOULD BE CLASS MYMAP IMPLEMENTS NAVIGABLEMAP COULD THEN LET THIS CLASS EXTEND THE CLASS YOU BUT I WOULD CONSIDER IT BETTER TO HAVE A PRIVATE MEMBER OF MYMAP BEING OF CLASS TREEMAP AS YOU THEN ONLY EXPOSE THOSE METHODS YOU ACTUALLY WANT AND NOT ALL THOSE THAT TREEMAP HAS REQUIRES A LOT OF WORK TO WRITE THE FORWARDING BUT ECLIPSE HAS GOOD REFACTORINGS THAT ALLOW YOU TO GENERATE THEM RAVN

ALREADY HAS AN ESTABLISHED MECHANISM FOR CODE SHARING MAKES GEM CREATION RECOMMEND THAT YOU CHECK IT	
ALREADY HAVE 2 POINTS STRAIGHT UP FROM THE POINTS FROM THE ORIGIN TO YOUR THE UNIT VECTOR TO YOUR A UNIT VECTOR PERPENDICULAR TO U AND U X A UNIT VECTOR PERPENDICULAR TO U AND E WILL BE TANGENT TO THE U X COULD BE POINTING EITHER NORTH OR MULTIPLY T BY NOW POINTS DUE AND IS PARALLEL TO THE PLANE TANGENT TO THE SPHERE AT NOW HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO CONSTRUCT A ROTATION MATRIX SO YOU CAN ROTATE T AROUND YOU CAN FIND HOW TO MAKE A MATRIX FOR ROTATION AROUND ANY AXIS ON YOU CAN CALCULATE A VECTOR POINTING IN THE DIRECTION OF RT IS THE ANSWER YOU ARE LOOKING	
ALREADY RECOMMENDED THIS SITE IN AN ANSWER TO A SIMILAR TRY IT GOT ME STARTED AND MIGHT HELP YOU AS BECOMING A GOOD DEVELOPER IS A TASK FOR MANY WHAT COUNTS MOST IS EXPERIENCE AND YOU WILL NOT GET THAT FROM MAGAZINES OR ONLINE	
ALREADY SOME GREAT ANSWERS IN SO I POST I WILL GIVE A COUPLE OF GOTCHAS MAKE SURE TO TEST FOR ANYTHING ELSE MAY BE AS SOMEONE WHOSE HOBBY CONCERNS TELNET YOU WILL PROBABLY WANT TO INCLUDE MORE THAN IN YOUR BUT MAY WANT TO PREVENT SAY OR SOME OTHER IS THAT MANY PEOPLE WILL DELIMIT THEIR LINKS IN LIKE OR IN PARENS AND NOTHING WORSE THAN CLICKING A AND HAVING THE CLOSING OR GO ALLONG WITH THE REST OF THE SORRY FOR THE PLUGS	
ALSO BECAUSE A CLASSLESS THE JAVA BUT TOTALLY OBJECT ORIENTED SO YOU CAN CALL ANY EVEN IF NOT AND YOU STILL GET A LAST CHANCE TO DYNAMICALLY RESPOND TO THE FOR EXAMPLE CREATING METHODS AS NECESSARRY ON THE ALSO RUBY NEED COMPILATION SO YOU CAN UPDATE A RUNNING APPLICATION EASILY IF YOU WANTED ALSO AN OBJECT CAN SUDDENLY INHERIT FROM ANOTHER AT ANYTIME DURING LIFETIME THROUGH MIXINS SO ANOTHER POINT OF ANYWAYS I AGREE WITH THE KIDS THAT THIS LANGUAGE CALLED RUBY WHICH HAS ACTUALLY BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS IS VERY FLEXIBLE AND GREAT IN MANY BUT I STILL BEEN ABLE TO AGREE BEATIFUL C IS MORE BEATIFUL IMHO A SUCKER FOR BUT BEAUTY IS THE OTHER QUALITIES OF RUBY ARE OBJECTIVE	
ALSO HARD ANY LANGUAGE WITH A GC CANNOT BE JUST IN CASE IT DECIDES TO COLLECT DURING A PART OF THE JAVA WAS NOTORIOUS FOR NOT EVEN ALLOWING YOU TO TRY THE EULA ABOUT NOT USING IT FOR SOFTWARE FOR USE IN THE OPERATION OR MAINTENANCE OF ANY NUCLEAR I KNOW SINCE MADE A MODIFIED VERSION OF JAVA FOR REAL TIME	
ALSO HAS AN INTERESTING FEATURE WHEN DECLARING AT THE PLACE OF DECLARATION OF THE YOU CAN ALSO DECLARE SOME POSSIBLE OF THE VARIABLE AND LABEL THEM WITH YOU CAN IS IS ESPECIALLY NICE IF THE VALUES ARE NOT PARTICULARLY MEANINGFUL MAGIC NUMBERS OR EVEN MAGIC THOSE MAGIC VALUES ONLY APPEAR IN THE DECLARATION OF THE VARIABLE AND ARE NICELY LABELED WITH WHAT THEY CAN EVEN THE VARIABLE TO ONE OF THESE VALUES TO	
ALSO HAS THEIR OWN JCE WHETHER THEY SUPPORT IBE IS ANOTHER	
ALSO HAVE A TENDENCY TO STAY AWAY FROM THE VARIOUS CSS SOMETHING THAT I FIND IS TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING OF A BASIC TEMPLATE OF YOUR OWN TO WORK OFF A CSS SUCH AS ONE ERIC AN ALTERNATIVE I CURRENTLY BECAUSE I PERSONALLY USE MOST OF THE XHTML TAGS INCLUDED IN RESET WOULD BE TIM BROWSER DEFAULTS BROWSER DEFAULTS THEN TRY TO COME UP WITH YOUR OWN SET OF TYPOGRAPHIC WHILE THINKING ABOUT SUCH GOOD THINGS AS VERTICAL RHYTHM AND I FIND A GOOD RESOURCE TO BE GRID GRID WHICH HAS TEMPLATES AND THE INCLUDING SOME USEFUL TOOLS FOR COMING UP WITH A GOOD TYPOGRAPHIC WOULD SHY AWAY FROM THE CSS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE NEVER VERY AND THE MULTITUDE OF DIV TAGS REALLY IRKS	
ALSO HAVE BUT WHEN I ADD AN AND TO MY PROJECTS EVERYTHING WORKS	
ALSO HAVE CODE IN FRONT OF BUT FROM PROBABLY GET AN YOU HAVE LAZY LOADING ON AND NHIBERNATE WILL TRY TO LOAD THE ADDRESSES IT SHOULD NEVER RETURN AN INCORRECT ONLY COMPLAIN WHEN IT LOAD BEEN	
ALSO HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT	
ALSO MAJORING IN CS AND SPECIALIZED IN UI MAYBE YOUR CS UNIVERSITY DID NOT HAVE COURSES ABOUT UI IS NOT THE SAME AS THE FORMER IS ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAM SHOULD LOOK THE LATTER IS ABOUT WHAT THE PROGRAM SHOULD ARE SOME BOOKS THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO IF YOU WANT TO GET MORE INTO UI IN ALPHABETICAL FACE THE ESSENTIALS OF INTERACTION MAKE ME A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO WEB 2ND DESIGN OF EVERYDAY INMATES ARE RUNNING THE WHY HIGH TECH PRODUCTS DRIVE US CRAZY AND HOW TO RESTORE THE INTERFACE A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING A PREVIEW AND SOME ADDITIONAL MATERIAL IS COURSE THAT I WENT TO WAS MOSTLY BASED ON THE USER A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING I HAVE NOT YET READ THE BOOK JUST SKIMMED THROUGH BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD BOOK TO START LEARNING UI ALSO ALL THE OTHER BOOKS ARE THEN WHEN YOU HAVE READ SOME THEORY FROM THE YOU JUST NEED TO PRACTICE UI DESIGN UNTIL YOU DEVELOP A SENSE FOR GOOD AND BAD AND GET SOME TRAINING IN REQUIREMENTS GATHERING AND USABILITY TESTING	
ALSO NEED TO CHECK FOR FOREIGN KEYS ON ANY TABLES THAT YOU MAY BE CONSIDER ANY DATA CHANGES THAT YOU MIGHT MAKE DELETE ROWS BEFORE TRYING TO INSERT A SECOND ALSO MIGHT WANT TO PUT IN CODE TO CHECK FOR DATA BEFORE DELETING TABLES AS A SAFEGUARD SO THAT YOU DROP TABLES THAT ARE ALREADY BEING	
ALSO RAN INTO THE SAME PROBLEM ON A SERVER THAT ONLY HAS 20GB ON THE I FOUND A WAY TO FREE UP ENOUGH SPACE TO GET THE JOB DONE BY REASSIGNED THE VIRTUAL MEMORY ALLOCATION TO USE DRIVE INSTEAD OF THIS FREED UP ABOUT 4GB IN MY WINDOWS XP THE PLACE TO SET THIS IS IN MY COMPUTER SYSTEM ADVANCED PERFORMANCE	
ALSO RECOMMEND YOU MOVING MOST OF YOUR CODE INTO THE USER MODEL INSTEAD OF THE THINK FAT PATTERN IS MORE EXPENDABLE AND MAINTAINABLE THEN EXTENDING ALSO USE THE EXTENDING A GENERIC LOGIN CONTROLLER FOR MY BUT THE GENERIC CONTROLLER JUST HAS A FUNCTIONS THAT GETS THE INPUTS AND SENDS THEM TO THE MODEL AND REDIRECTS OR SENDS AN ERROR TO THE	
ALSO RELEASE A RESOURCE KIT FOR DEVELOPING WEB APPS CALLED IT HAS A SAMPLE MVC APP IN	
ALSO TESTED IT IN SAFARI AND IT WORKS IF THIS IS STILL A CHECK TO SEE WHETHER THE ALPHABETICAL ORDERING IS BASED ON OPTION VALUE OR OPTION IF ON OPTION JUST NUMBER THE IF IT IS BASED ON THE ACTUAL SELECTION THEN YOU MAY HAVE TO NUMBER THE	
ALSO UNSURE OF WHAT TO MAKE OF REFERENCING AN ENTITY FROM A DONE SO MYSELF A STATE NO FAR AS THE PRETTY CLASS MYENTITYMAP PUBLIC C WHAT I DO IS ADD A STATIC CLASS FOR THE COMPONENT TO MAKE THE CLASSMAP A LITTLE STATIC CLASS PUBLIC STATIC RETURN C AND SO THIS CASE COLUMNNAME IS A SIMPLE FUNCTION THAT ATTACHES THE PREFIX TO THE COLUMN NAME IS PRETTY HANDY IN THE WONDERFUL LEGACY DBS I GET TO PLAY IN THE CLASSMAP YOU JUST C	
ALSO USE SUBVERSION ALONG WITH TORTOISESVN BUT I BOTHER WITH THE VS INTEGRATION I DID BUY VISUAL I USE THE OTHER THING TO IS THAT I HAVE HAD GOOD LUCK WITH A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE SVN SERVICE CALLED IT IS EASY TO SET UP AND TAKES ALL THE SERVER HEADACHES OFF MY THEY ARE AT I AM AFFILIATED WITH THEM EXCEPT AS A CUSTOMER BUT I DO LIKE TO PASS ALONG RECOMMENDATIONS WHEN I LIKE A

ALTERING YOUR CODE VERY PRINTWRITER WRITER NEW STR	
ALTERNATE TO IS I LIKED THE DESKTOP INTEGRATION THEY	
ALTERNATIVE IS TO DECLARE YOUR RECURSIVE FUNC DELEGATES AS STATIC FACTORIAL N 1 1	
ALTERNATIVE IS TO EXTEND THIS THREAD CLASS TO ACCEPT A FUNCTOR AS ONLY CONSTRUCTOR SO THAT YOU CAN BIND ANY CALL INSIDE THE CLASS USING THREADS WONT NEED TO INHERIT FROM BUT ONLY HAVE ONE THREAD THE FUNCTOR CALLS ANY START POINT YOU WANT SOME METHOD OF THE CLASS WITH ANY PARAMETERS	
ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION IS MOST LIKELY SUITING YOU IF IT IS ID SUGGEST USING NOT EXISTS RATHER THAN LEFT JOIN IF POSSIBLE IN YOUR LEAST ON MS SQL IT WOULD GIVE A SLIGHTLY CHEAPER QUERY SINCE IT WOULD NOT NEED THE LAST FILTERING IS MESSAGE NOT EXISTS SELECT FROM WHERE AND

ALWAYS PREFER A WRAPPER WHENEVER USING THIRD PARTY ALLOWS ME TO DEFINE MY OWN EXCEPTION HANDLING MECHANISM AVOIDING USERS OF MY CLASS TO KNOW ABOUT EXTERNAL IF LATER THE THIRD PARTY CHANGES THE EXCEPTION HANDLING TO RETURN CODES THEN MY USERS NEED NOT BE RATHER THAN THROWING THE EXCEPTION BACK TO MY USERS I WOULD IMPLEMENT THE ERROR SOMETHING LIKE ENUM BOOL INT PRICE INT PRICE BOOL BRETURN BRETURN BRETURN RETURN BOOL MYREQUEST BOOL BRETURN FALSE THE ERROR CODE AND	
ALWAYS PREFER MULTIPLE THREADS FOR BUT THERE IS A REAL ISSUE WITH THERE IS NO WAY I KNOW TO TELL THREADING IMPLEMENTATION TO BIND TO A SPECIFIC THIS MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE FOR IT DOESNT SOUND LIKE IT SHOULD UNLESS YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON NOT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED EASILY WITH THREADING YOU DO DECIDED ON USING SHARING INFORMATION BETWEEN SUB PROCESSES CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN SEVERAL SHARED MEMORY OR IT DOES ADD SOME OVERHEAD AND	
ALWAYS PUT IN MY 403 404 500 FOR WHATEVER ERRORS I THEN JUST SWITCH CASE ON THINK THERE IS ANY MORE SOPHISTICATED WAY OF DOING

BUT IN GENERAL REDIRECT ALL PAGES THAT NEED TO BE TO THEIR EQUIVALENT AND ONLY USE SSL WHEN A SSL CERTIFICATE FOR YOUR CDN JUST 30 BUT YOU NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THIS REQUIRES MORE CONFIGURATION AND DEPENDING ON THE THIS IS ALSO MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THE SERVER REQUIRES MORE RESOURCES FOR THE RELEVANT STORE THE FILES ON YOUR OWN SSL HOST AND USE THEM WHEN YOU NEED OF COURSE YOU LOOSE THE SPEED FROM THE BUT A TRADE WE OPTED FOR THIS BECAUSE JUST OUR SIGNUP IS OF THE TIME USERS SPEND ON OUR WEBSITE IS ON

COMMENTS ON CONSTRUCTING WHERE CLAUSES IN EXAMPLE IS BY DEFINITION GOING TO BE BECAUSE PUTTING SINGLE QUOTES WHERE THEY AND AND PRODUCE THIS AND AND IS OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO THE SINGLE QUOTES OUT AND IT SHOULD THAT NEVER DO IT THAT NEVER PUT THE AND IN THE SUBSTRINGS THAT ARE USED TO CONSTRUCT THE WHERE BECAUSE WHAT WOULD I DO IF I HAVE A VALUE FOR THE SECOND STRING BUT NOT FOR THE YOU HAVE TO CONCATENATE A NUMBER OF STRINGS WITH A DELIMITER AND SOME CAN BE ONE THING TO DO IS TO JUST CONCATENATE THEM ALL AND NOT WORRY IF THE STRING BEFORE THE CONCATENATION IS UNASSIGNED OF CONCATENATE 0 STRWHERE STRWHERE AND 0 STRWHERE STRWHERE AND 0 STRWHERE STRWHERE AND ALL THREE STRINGS ARE THAT WOULD GIVE AND 5 AND 123 AND USE TO CHOP OF THE FIRST 5 CHARACTERS AND IT WILL ALWAYS COME OUT REGARDLESS OF WHICH OF THE VARIABLES HAVE VALUES NONE OF THEM ARE GET A WHICH IS WHAT YOU IF ANY ONE OF THEM IS FIRST GET AND WHICH IS AN ERRONEOUS LEADING WHICH YOU JUST CHOP OUT WITH THE THIS WORKS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT ALL THE RESULTS BEFORE THE WILL START WITH AND NO MATTER WHAT NO NEEDLESS TESTS FOR WHETHER OR NOT STRWHERE ALREADY HAS BEEN ASSIGNED A VALUE JUST STICK THE AND IN THERE AND CHOP IT OFF AT THE ANOTHER SOMEONE MENTIONED SQL IN REGARDS TO THERE WAS A LENGTHY DISCUSSION OF THAT WHICH CONSIDERS A LOT OF ISSUES CLOSE TO THIS SQL

COULD CREATE A TEMPORARY THEN CREATE A CURSOR FOR A SELECTION FROM THE CARS TABLE AND FOR EACH ROW DYNAMICALLY CREATE AND EXECUTE AN SQL QUERY THAT ADDS A FIELD TO THE TEMPORARY WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO DO SOMETHING LIKE YOU ARE MIXING DATA WITH META AND THAT IS RARELY A GOOD THE CODE FOR POPULATING THE TEMPORARY TABLE WITH DATA WILL BE EVEN WORSE THAN THE CODE FOR CREATING THINK THAT YOU ARE TOO MUCH FOCUSED ON GETTING THE OUTPUT FROM THE STORED PROCEDURE TO LOOK LIKE HOW YOU ARE GOING TO DISPLAY INSTEAD TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE DATA SHOULD BE ARRANGED TO BE CONVENIENT TO WORK	
COULD CREATE A TO HOLD THE PARAMETER	
COULD CREATE A WITH EACH ENTRY CONTAINING AN ENUM ENTRY AS A KEY AND A DELEGATE TO RETRIEVE THE DROP DOWN DATA AS THE THIS WOULD ALLOW YOU TO KEEP EACH METHOD THAT RETURNS A DROP DOWN LIST SEPARATE AND OUT OF THE HUGE SWITCH YOU WOULD THEN HAVE ONE METHOD TO RETRIEVE THE EXECUTE AND RETURN THE DROP DOWN LIST

COULD USE WHICH CONTAINS BUILT IN THIS IS POSSIBLY THE BEST AND EASIEST SINCE IT PROBABLY WOULD TAKE QUITE A LOT OF WORK TO IMPLEMENT YOUR OWN REPLICATION ABOUT TO DO EXACTLY THAT FOR A PROJECT WORKING THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT SINCE USING PHP FOR THE IMPLEMENTED LUCENE IN A SOCKET SERVER THAT ACCEPTS QUERIES AND RETURNS A LIST OF DB PRIMARY MY PLAN IS TO PUSH CHANGES TO THE SERVER AND STORE THEM IN A WHERE FIRST STORE THEM INTO THE THE MEMORY AND THEN FLUSH THE MEMORY INDEX TO DISK WHEN THE LOAD IS LOW A COMPLEX THING TO DO AND SET ON DOING QUITE A LOT OF WORK BEFORE WE HAVE A STABLE FINAL SOLUTION RELIABLE

DID SOME QUICK INSPECTION OF THE STRING PROVIDED BY THE THE SMALL IN FRONT OF THE CURLY BRACE IS A 0XBB I KNOW WHY THIS BYTE SEQUENCE IS DISPLAYED AS THE SYSTEM YOU AQUIRE THE DATA FROM SENDS IT ENCODED IN WITH A BOM PRECEDING THE YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE FIRST THREE BYTES FROM THE STRING BEFORE YOU THROW IT INTO WILL THIS IS THE THIS CHARACTER SURELY IS THE REASON WHY THE STRING IN ITS GIVEN FORM IS NOT CORRECTLY A JSON FORMATED STRUCTURE	
DID SOMETHING SIMILAR A WHILE BACK TO ANNOTATE FIELDS WITH TRIED TO ADAPT IT TO ANNOTATED WHICH SHOUD WORK OF SHOULD ADD A BIT OF ERROR CHECKING AND HERE SINCE LEFT THAT OUT FOR CAN GET THE VALUE OF THE ANNOTATION USING THE JOIN STATIC STRING JOINPOINT METHODSIGNATURE METHODSIG METHOD METHOD PROFILED ANNOTATION RETURN AVOID TOO MUCH PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO USE ADVICE STRING OPNAME

INT FLOWERSINVASE FLOWERSINVASE 0 TAKE ONE FLOWER FLOWERSINVASE 1 ELSE THE VASE IS NOTHING TO WE HAVE JUST DONE THAT IN A FOR RECURSION CAN BE REPLACED WITH BUT OFTEN RECURSION IS MORE TALK ABOUT IN COMPUTER A IS A STRUCTURE MADE UP OF WHERE EACH NODE HAS SOME NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT ARE ALSO OR A IS A TREE MADE OF NODES THAT HAVE EXACTLY TYPICALLY CALLED AND AGAIN THE CHILDREN CAN BE OR A IS A NODE THAT IS NOT THE CHILD OF ANY OTHER THAT A IN ADDITION TO ITS HAS A A AND IMAGINE THAT WE WISH TO SUM ALL THE VALUES IN SOME SUM VALUE IN ANY ONE WE WOULD ADD THE VALUE OF NODE ITSELF TO THE VALUE OF ITS LEFT IF AND THE VALUE OF ITS RIGHT IF NOW RECALL THAT THE IF NOT ARE ALSO TO SUM THE LEFT WE WOULD ADD THE VALUE OF CHILD NODE ITSELF TO THE VALUE OF ITS LEFT IF AND THE VALUE OF ITS RIGHT IF TO SUM THE VALUE OF THE LEFT LEFT WE WOULD ADD THE VALUE OF CHILD NODE ITSELF TO THE VALUE OF ITS LEFT IF AND THE VALUE OF ITS RIGHT IF ANTICIPATED WHERE GOING WITH AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME NODE INT ROOT IF THERE IS NO ITS SUM IS ROOT NULL RETURN 0 ELSE THERE IS A RETURN THAT INSTEAD OF EXPLICITLY TESTING THE CHILDREN TO SEE IF NULL OR WE JUST MAKE THE RECURSIVE FUNCTION RETURN ZERO FOR A NULL SAY WE HAVE A TREE THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS NUMBERS ARE THE SLASHES POINT TO AND MEANS THE POINTER POINTS TO 4 2 1 WE CALL SUMNODE ON THE ROOT NODE WITH VALUE WE WILL 5 EXPAND THAT IN EVERYWHERE WE SEE REPLACE IT WITH THE EXPANSION OF THE RETURN 5 5 4 5 4 2 NULL 5 4 2 0 5 4 2 0 1 NULL 5 4 2 0 1 0 5 4 2 0 1 0 3 NULL 5 4 2 0 1 0 3 0 0 5 4 2 0 1 0 3 5 4 2 0 1 3 5 4 2 1 3 5 4 3 5 3 5 10 15 SEE HOW WE CONQUERED A STRUCTURE OF ARBITRARY DEPTH AND BY CONSIDERING IT AS THE REPEATED APPLICATION OF A COMPOSITE EACH TIME THROUGH OUR SUMNODE WE DEALT WITH ONLY A SINGLE USING A SINGE AND TWO SIMPLE RETURN STATEMENTS THAT ALMOST WROTE DIRECTLY FROM OUR TO SUM A IF A NODE IS NULL ITS SUM IS OTHERWISE ITS SUM IS ITS VALUE PLUS THE SUM OF ITS LEFT CHILD PLUS THE SUM OF ITS RIGHT CHILD THE POWER OF VASE EXAMPLE ABOVE IS AN EXAMPLE OF ALL THAT MEANS IS THAT IN THE RECURSIVE IF WE RECURSED IF WE CALLED THE FUNCTION THAT WAS THE LAST THING WE TREE EXAMPLE WAS NOT TAIL BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THAT LAST THING WE DID WAS TO RECURSE THE RIGHT BEFORE WE DID THAT WE RECURSED THE LEFT THE ORDER IN WHICH WE CALLED THE AND ADDED THE CURRENT VALUE MATTER AT BECAUSE ADDITION IS LOOK AT AN OPERATION WHERE ORDER DOES USE A BINARY TREE OF BUT THIS TIME THE VALUE HELD WILL BE A NOT A TREE WILL HAVE A SPECIAL THAT FOR ANY ITS CHARACTER COMES ALPHABETICAL THE CHARACTER HELD BY ITS LEFT CHILD AND ALPHABETICAL THE CHARACTER HELD BY ITS RIGHT WE WANT TO DO IS PRINT THE TREE IS ALPHABETICAL EASY TO GIVEN THE TREE SPECIAL WE JUST PRINT THE LEFT THEN THE THEN RIGHT JUST WANT TO PRINT SO PASS OUR FUNCTION SOMETHING TO PRINT THIS WILL BE AN OBJECT WITH A CHAR WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT HOW IT JUST THAT WHEN PRINT IS PRINT SEE THAT IN NODE CHAR WORRY ABOUT THIS PRINTER PRIVATE O VOID CHAR C OUT WORRY ABOUT THIS PRINTER IF THERE IS NO DO ROOT NULL RETURN ELSE THERE IS A PRINTER VALUE PRINTER ROOT THIS FUNCTION RETURNS A PRINTER ADDITION TO THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS NOW THIS EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES THAT WE CAN PASS THINGS INTO A RECURSIVE THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT ON EACH RECURSIVE WE CONTINUE TO PASS IT WE PASSED IN A NODE POINTER AND A PRINTER TO THE AND ON EACH RECURSIVE WE PASSED THEM IF OUR TREE LOOKS LIKE H A J WILL WE WE GO LEFT WHERE WE GO LEFT WHERE WE GO LEFT TO WHERE WE DO NOTHING AND WE RETURN TO WHERE WE PRINT AND THEN GO RIGHT WHERE WE DO NOTHING AND WE RETURN TO A AND ARE WE RETURN TO WHERE WE PRINT AND THEN GO RIGHT WHERE WE GO LEFT WHERE WE GO LEFT TO WHERE WE DO NOTHING AND WE RETURN TO WHERE WE PRINT AND THEN GO RIGHT WHERE WE DO NOTHING AND WE RETURN TO I AND ARE WE RETURN TO WHERE WE PRINT AND THEN GO RIGHT WHERE WE DO NOTHING AND WE RETURN TO J AND ARE WE RETURN TO H AND ARE RETURN TO WHERE WE PRINT AND THEN GO RIGHT N WHERE WE GO LEFT TO WHERE WE DO NOTHING AND WE RETURN TO WHERE WE PRINT AND THEN GO RIGHT WHERE WE DO NOTHING AND WE RETURN TO N AND ARE SO RETURN TO K AND ARE SO WE RETURN TO THE IF WE JUST LOOK AT THE LINES WERE WE WE RETURN TO WHERE WE PRINT AND THEN GO RIGHT WE RETURN TO WHERE WE PRINT AND THEN GO RIGHT WE RETURN TO WHERE WE PRINT AND THEN GO RIGHT WE RETURN TO WHERE WE PRINT AND THEN GO RIGHT RETURN TO WHERE WE PRINT AND THEN GO RIGHT WE RETURN TO WHERE WE PRINT AND THEN GO RIGHT SEE WE PRINTED WHICH IS INDEED IN ALPHABETICAL MANAGE TO PRINT AN ENTIRE IN ALPHABETICAL JUST BY KNOWING HOW TO PRINT A SINGLE NODE IN ALPHABETICAL WHICH WAS JUST OUR TREE HAD THE SPECIAL PROPERTY OF ORDERING VALUES TO THE LEFT OF ALPHABETICALLY LATER KNOWING TO PRINT THE LEFT CHILD BEFORE PRINTING THE AND TTO PRINT THE RIGHT CHILD AFTER PRINTING THE THE POWER OF BEING ABLE TO DO WHOLE THINGS BY KNOWING ONLY HOW TO DO A PART OF THE WHOLE KNOWING WHEN TO STOP THAT IN MOST OPERATOR WHEN ITS FIRST OPERAND IS THE GENERAL RECURSIVE FUNCTION M SHOULD CREATE A BADGE FOR THIS KIND OF BECAUSE I EDITED THIS ANSWER MORE THAN FOUR TIMES ADD THE LAST BUT MOSTLY TO CORRECT TYPOS AND POLISH IT TYPING ON A TINY NETBOOK KEYBOARD IS I GET ANY MORE POINTS FOR WHICH SOMEWHAT DISCOURAGES ME FROM PUTTING AS MUCH EFFORT INTO FUTURE MY COMMENT HERE ON

DYNAMIC SQL CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT FOR THE SOME OF THE COMMENTS HERE SEEM TO ENDORSE MY VIEW THAT DYNAMIC SQL CAN BE CONFUSING TO THE HUMAN ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WRITE THE CODE OF THE PERSON WHO WILL INHERIT YOUR PREFER STATIC SQL IN A AND MAKE THE CALL TO THE PROC DYNAMIC AT RUNTIME BY CHOOSING APPROPRIATE IF YOU USE SQL DDL TO DEFINE THE PROC YOU CAN SPECIFY VALUES FOR THE PARAMETERS SO THE CALLER CAN SIMPLY OMIT THE ONES THAT ARE NOT NEEDED SEE IF YOU CAN FOLLOW THE LOGIC IN THIS PROCEDURE INTEGER INTEGER INTEGER FROM DB WHERE COL1 IS AND COL2 IS AND COL3 IS IT MAY NOT YIELD THE BEST EXECUTION PLAN BUT IMO YOU HAVE TO BALANCE OPTIMIZATION AGAINST GOOD DESIGN PRINCIPLES IT RUNS REALLY QUICK ON MY MACHINE

EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS WOULD BE TO HAVE A BASE ARGUMENT WHICH IS NOT AND THEN HAVE THE SPECIFIC DATA TYPES DERIVE FROM COULD EVEN MAKE THE TEMPLATED VERSION DERIVE FROM THE BASE CLASS DIRECTLY AND JUST USE THOSE TWO THEN YOU STORE THEM AS POINTERS IN A DOES REQUIRE HAVING SOME SORT OF FUNCTIONS TO ACCESS THE ARGUMENT VALUES AND PERFORM ANY CONVERSIONS AS	
EASIEST WAY TO FIX THIS IS TO CREATE A VARIABLE THAT REFERENCES AT THE PROPER SCOPE AND SCOPE WORK DIFFERENTLY IN JAVASCRIPT THEN MOST IN THIS CASE IT IS REFERRING TO THE OBJECT BEING PASSED INTO THE GET LATEST AND ROOM DATA FROM VAR SELF STARTUP	
EASIEST WAY WOULD BE NOT TO PASS THROUGH THE DIFFERENT BUT TO ACCESS IT DIRECTLY FROM PRINT YOUR ORIGINAL FUNCTION YOU COULD ALSO USE A LAMBDA FUNCTION IN

ME TAKE A CRACK AT FIRST WRITTEN SOME ON THIS SUBJECT IN AN ORM OR PLAIN SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS YOUR OF IS ABOUT IF YOU KNOW SQL THE LEARNING CURVE FOR IBATIS IS IBATIS DOES SOME THINGS ON TOP OF SQL SUCH STILL NEED TO LEARN BUT THE BIGGEST HURDLE IS INCLUDES ON THE OTHER HAND TRIES TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM SQL AND PRESENT THINGS IN AN OBJECT RATHER THAN A RELATIONAL AS JOEL POINTS OUT ARE AND JPA IS NO TO DO JPA STILL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT RELATIONAL PERFORMANCE TUNING OF QUERIES AND SO IBATIS WILL SIMPLY HAVING YOU APPLY THE SQL YOU KNOW OR ARE JPA WILL REQUIRE YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING HOW TO CONFIGURE IT XML OR BY THIS I MEAN FIGURING OUT THAT FOREIGN KEY RELATIONSHIPS ARE A RELATIONSHIP OR OF SOME THE TYPE YOU KNOW SQL I WOULD SAY THE BARRIER TO LEARNING JPA IS ACTUALLY IF YOU MORE OF A MIXED RESULT WITH JPA ALLOWING YOU TO EFFECTIVELY DEFER LEARNING SQL FOR A TIME IT PUT IT OFF JPA ONCE YOU SETUP YOUR ENTITIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS THEN OTHER DEVELOPERS CAN SIMPLY USE THEM AND NEED TO LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT CONFIGURING THIS COULD BE AN ADVANTAGE BUT A DEVELOPER WILL STILL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ENTITY TRANSACTION MANAGED VS UNMANAGED OBJECTS AND SO WORTH NOTING THAT JPA ALSO HAS ITS OWN QUERY LANGUAGE WHICH YOU WILL NEED TO LEARN WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW YOU WILL FIND SITUATIONS WHERE JUST DO THINGS THAT SQL IS A HARD ONE TO PERSONALLY I THINK MORE PRODUCTIVE IN IBATIS BUT ALSO REALLY COMFORTABLE WITH SOME WILL ARGUE WAY MORE PRODUCTIVE WITH HIBERNATE BUT THIS IS POSSIBLY LEAST IN UNFAMILIARITY WITH THE PRODUCTIVITY WITH JPA IS DECEPTIVE BECAUSE YOU WILL OCCASIONALLY COME ACROSS A PROBLEM WITH YOUR DATA MODEL OR QUERIES THAT TAKES YOU A HALF A DAY TO A DAY TO SOLVE AS YOU TURN UP LOGGING AND WATCH WHAT SQL YOUR JPA PROVIDER IS PRODUCING AND THEN WORKING OUT THE COMBINATION OF SETTINGS AND CALLS TO GET IT TO PRODUCE SOMETHING BOTH CORRECT AND JUST HAVE THIS KIND OF PROBLEM WITH IBATIS BECAUSE WRITTEN THE SQL YOU TEST IT BY RUNNING THE SQL INSIDE SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT NAVICAT FOR MYSQL OR AFTER THE QUERY IS ALL DOING IS MAPPING INPUTS AND I FOUND TO BE MORE AWKWARD THAN PURE YOU NEED SEPARATE TOOLS TO JUST RUN A QUERY TO SEE THE RESULTS AND SOMETHING MORE YOU HAVE TO I ACTUALLY FOUND THIS WHOLE PART OF JPA RATHER AWKWARD AND UNWIELDY ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE LOVE DANGER WITH IBATIS HERE IS PROLIFERATION MEANING YOUR DEV TEAM MAY JUST KEEP ADDING VALUE OBJECTS AND QUERIES AS THEY NEED THEM RATHER THAN LOOKING FOR REUSE WHEREAS JPA HAS ONE ENTITTY PER TABLE AND ONCE YOU HAVE THAT NAMED QUERIES TEND TO GO ON THAT ENTITY SO ARE HARD TO QUERIES CAN STILL BE REPEATED BUT I THINK LESS OF A POTENTIAL COMES AT THE COST OF RIGIDITY OFTEN IN AN APPLICATION YOU WILL NEED BITS AND PIECES OF DATA FROM DIFFERENT WITH SQL EASY BECAUSE YOU CAN WRITE A SINGLE QUERY A SMALL NUMBER OF TO GET ALL THAT DATA IN ONE HIT AND PUT IT IN A CUSTOM VALUE OBJECT JUST FOR THAT JPA YOU ARE MOVING UP THAT LOGIC INTO YOUR BUSINESS ENTITIES ARE BASICALLY ALL OR NOW NOT STRICTLY VARIOUS JPA PROVIDERS WILL ALLOW YOU TO PARTIALLY LOAD ENTITIES AND SO FORTH BUT EVEN THERE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME DISCRETE IF YOU NEED DATA FROM 4 TABLES YOU EITHER NEED 4 ENTITIES OR YOU NEED TO COMBINE THE DATA YOU WANT INTO SOME KIND OF CUSTOM VALUE OBJECT IN THE BUSINESS OR PRESENTATION OTHER THING I LIKE ABOUT IBATIS IS THAT ALL YOUR SQL IS EXTERNAL XML SOME WILL CITE THIS IS AS A DISADVANTAGE BUT NOT YOU CAN THEN FIND USES OF A TABLE COLUMN RELATIVELY EASY BY SEARCHING YOUR XML WITH SQL EMBEDDED IN CODE WHERE THERE IS NO SQL AT IT CAN BE A LOT HARDER TO YOU CAN ALSO CUT AND PASTE SQL INTO A DATABASE TOOL AND RUN I OVERSTATE ENOUGH HOW MANY TIMES THIS HAS BEEN USEFUL TO ME OVER THE I THINK IBATIS WINS HANDS STRAIGHT SQL AND LOW BY ITS NATURE JPA SIMPLY BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE SAME LEVEL OF LATENCY OR NOW WHAT JPA HAS GOING FOR IT IS THAT LATENCY AND THROUGHPUT ARE ONLY RARELY HIGH PERFORMANCE SYSTEMS HOWEVER DO EXIST AND WILL TEND TO DISFAVOUR MORE HEAVYWEIGHT SOLUTIONS LIKE WITH IBATIS YOU CAN WRITE A QUERY THAT RETURNS EXACTLY THE DATA YOU WANT WITH THE EXACT COLUMNS THAT YOU FUNDAMENTALLY NO WAY JPA CAN BEAT EVEN THAT WHEN RETURNING DISCRETE OF THINK THIS ONE IS A WIN FOR IBATIS LIKE I MENTIONED WITH JPA YOU WILL SOMETIMES SPEND HALF A DAY GETTING A QUERY OR ENTITY PRODUCE THE SQL YOU WANT OR DIAGNOSING A PROBLEM WHERE A TRANSACTION FAILS BECAUSE THE ENTITY MANAGER TRIED TO PERSIST AN UNMANAGED OBJECT COULD BE PART OF A BATCH JOB WHERE COMMITTED A LOT OF WORK SO IT MIGHT BE NONTRIVIAL TO OF THEM WILL FAIL IF YOU TRY TO USE A TABLE OR COLUMN THAT WHICH IS YOU MENTION PORTABILITY AS ONE OF YOUR REQUIREMENTS MOVING BETWEEN DATABASE WORTH NOTING THAT HERE JPA HAS THE THE ANNOTATIONS ARE LESS PORTABLE HIBERNATE XML STANDARD JPA ANNOTATIONS HAVE AN EQUIVALENT FOR ID BUT BOTH OF THEM ARE MORE PORTABLE THAN IBATIS SEEN JPA HIBERNATE USED AS A FORM OF PORTABLE MEANING YOU RUN A SMALL JAVA PROGRAM THAT CREATES THE DATABASE SCHEMA FROM JPA WITH IBATIS NEED A SCRIPT FOR EACH SUPPORTED DOWNSIDE OF PORTABILITY IS THAT JPA IN SOME LOWEST COMMON MEANING THE SUPPORTED BEHAVIOUR IS LARGELY THE COMMON SUPPORTED BEHAVIOUR ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF DATABASE IF YOU WANT TO USE ORACLE ANALYTICS IN NO IN A

MY OPINION FOR POSTAL CODES YOU HAVE TO USE BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE POSTAL CODES THAT STARDS WITH ZEROS AND IF YOU USE INTEGERS IT WOULD BE SORTING IS NOT A BECAUSE THERE IS STILL AN ALPHABETICAL ORDER COMES BEFORE STORING FILE NUMBERS I WOULD EXPECT AN SO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM IN INCRESING DECREASING ITS SO INTEGER VS STRINGS DEPENDS UPON THE USE YOU

MY OPINION THERE SOME THINGS YOU SHOULD THINK THE CUSTOMER NEED A FUNCTION TO CUSTOMIZE HIS THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES OR THE EFFORT OF CREATING SUCH AN WORTH I THINK THAT ITS PRETTY OBVIOUS WHY YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON YOUR PROJECT IF THAT KIND OF MODEL MAKES YOU WANT TO CREATE SOME A LOT OF FORMS THAT CAN BE CUSTOMIZED AT RUNTIME THEN THIS MODEL COULD BE PRETTY IF YOU NEED TO DO A LOT OF SMALLER TOOLS AND YOU USE THIS AS SOME KIND OF THEN THIS EFFORT COULD BE WORTH IT BECAUSE YOU CAN SAVE A LOT OF THAT KIND OF YOU COULD AUTOMATICALLY ADD ERROR CHECK THE VALUES OR ADD OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ALWAYS BUILD UP WITH THE SAME BUT IF YOU HAVE TOO MANY OF THIS ELEMENTS OR ATTRIBUTES THEN THE PERFORMANCE CAN GO DOWN THINGS THAT BECOMES INTERESTING IN BIGGER PROJECTS THAT CHANGES THAT HAVE TO OCCUR IN EACH FORM JUST HAVE TO BE MADE IN THE NOT IN EACH THIS COULD SAVE A LOT OF TIME IF THERE IS A BUG IN THE FINISHED OUR COMPANY WE USE A SIMILAR MODEL FOR AN INTERFACE GENERATOR BETWEEN NOW I CANT REMEMBER THE RIGHT WORD FOR AND OUR JUST THAT IT DOESNT CREATE AN BUT AN OUTPUT FILE FOR ONE OF THE USE XML TO DEFINE THE STRUCTURE AND HOW THE VALUES NEED TO BE CONVERTED AND SO

NEW TO TO DOUBLE AND I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE A TEXT EDITOR COULD AS EASILY OWN MULTIPLE BUS ADDITION TO GENERIC MULTIPLE OBJECTS WHERE NUMBER CHANGES ACCORDING TO AND EACH OBJECT IMPLEMENT MULTIPLE SUCH SAY I WANT TO CREATE A WRAPPER AROUND SUCH THAT THE SERVICE CAN EXPOSE A HANDFUL OF FLICKR API METHODS THIS IS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD IF I WANT TO ASSUME THAT THE SERVICE WILL ALWAYS BE SPECIFYING THE SAME API KEY AND THAT THE AUTH INFORMATION WILL BE THE SAME FOR EVERYONE USING THE IN THE LATTER I CANNOT REALLY ASSUME THIS WILL BE ON THE DOCUMENTATION QUOTED I AM ASSUMING THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE GET THE CONNECTION PROXY ASK THE CONNECTION OBJECT TO THE RETURN VALUE WOULD MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE GET THE SERVICE PROXY AS THE FLICKR SERVICE OBJECT TO GET GROUP MY IS THIS HOW THIS SHOULD BE IF HOW WILL THE SERVICE KNOW WHEN THE CLIENT IS IS THERE A WAY TO DETECT IF THE CURRENT CLIENT HAS BROKEN CONNECTION SO THAT THE SERVICE CAN CLEANUP ITS DYNAMICALLY CREATED HOW WOULD I CREATE THE INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS IN THE FIRST IF THIS IS NOT HOW THIS SHOULD BE WHAT ARE SOME OTHER SUGGESTIONS FOR ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING READ THROUGH A NUMBER OF TUTORIALS AND VARIOUS DOCUMENTATION AND ABOUT THE CLOSEST COME TO SEEING WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR IS WHAT I QUOTED NONE OF THE EXAMPLES LOOK TO ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS SO I AM NOT SURE HOW TO DO I CREATE A SERVICE THAT DYNAMICALLY CREATES MULTIPLE	
NEW TO USING DISTRIBUTED CACHING SOLUTIONS LIKE MEMCACHED ON A LARGE WEB I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND COULD SOMEONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCE ON THESE COMMENT THE AMOUNT OF DATA I CAN PUT INTO CACHE DEPENDS ON SERVER SUPPOSED I HAVE BIG ENOUGH SERVER FARM AND IS THERE A MAX NUMBER OF OBJECTS I CAN PUT INTO MEMCACHED BEFORE I START SEEING PERFORMANCE THE REASON I ASK IS THAT I FIGURE IF I PUT LITERALLY MILLIONS OF OBJECT INTO MEMCACHED IT TAKE LONGER FOR IT TO INDEX AND LOOK UP IS THERE A LINE TO DRAW I CACHE SMALLER BUT MORE OBJECTS IN OR BIGGER BUT LESS NUMBER OF SMALLER OBJECTS DO INVOLVE MORE ROUND TRIPS TO DB TO GET BUT IT IS MORE FLEXIBLE AND EASIER TO YOU VERY STRATEGIES WITH

NHIBERNATE CAN GENERATE YOUR MAPPING FILES BASED ON SIMPLE NO AND STRONGLY RECENTLY WORKED ON A WHERE WE NEEDED TO CHANGE FROM LINQ TO SQL TO NHIBERNATE FOR PERFORMANCE ESPECIALLY WAY OF MATERIALIZING THE OBJECTS SEEMS SLOWER THAN DITTO AND THE CHANGE MANAGEMENT IS QUITE SLOW AND IT CAN BE HARD TO TURN THE CHANGE MANAGEMENT OFF FOR SPECIFIC SCENARIOS WHERE IT IS NOT YOU ARE GOING TO USE YOUR ENTITIES DISCONNECTED FROM THE DATACONTEXT IN WCF SCENARIOS FOR EXAMPLE MAY HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE CONNECTING THEM TO THE DATACONTEXT AGAIN FOR UPDATING THE I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THAT WITH THING I WILL MISS FROM L2S IS MOSTLY THE CODE GENERATION THAT KEEPS RELATIONS ON BOTH ENDS OF THE BUT I GUESS THERE ARE SOME TOOLS FOR NHIBERNATE TO DO THAT OUT THERE	
NHIBERNATE ITSELF RARELY COMPLAINS AT YOU INTERNALLY JUST BUILDING UP YOUR HBM FILES FOR YOU SO IF YOU TOLD IT TO BUILD SOMETHING WRONG THEN NHIBERNATE PROPER WILL GET NOT YOU MIGHT WANT TO START WITH EXPORTING YOUR MAPPING FILES LIKE YOU CAN DIG AROUND IN THERE TO SEE IF SOMETHING IS I DO RECALL GETTING THIS ERROR ONCE BEFORE AND I THINK IT RELATES TO A MISMATCH IN THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS IT WAS ONE OF THOSE ERRORS IN MY SO UNFORTUNATELY ALL I CAN SUGGEST IS TO REALLY SCOUR THE OUTPUT OF FOR ANYTHING THAT MAKE	
NICE TUTORIAL ON HOW TO UPLOAD A FILE DIRECTLY INTO THE	
NICE TYPESAFE WAY TO DO THIS WITHOUT SPECIFYING THE DIMENSIONS AS A SEPARATE PARAMETERS IS AS ROWS COLUMNS 30 INT DOUBLE I I INT DOUBLE I I CHAR DOUBLE MODIFY EACH COLUMN OF THE 10TH ROW WITH THE VALUE OF 3 MODIFY EACH ROW OF THE 10TH COLUMN WITH THE VALUE OF 3 RETURN IS COMPLETELY WRONG TO PASS A DOUBLE FOR THIS DOUBLE INT I1 4 DOUBLE INT I2 240 COLUMNS YOU PASSED IN A DOUBLE THEN ACCESSED IT LIKE AN ARRAY YOU WOULD CAUSE A SEGFAULT OR UNDEFINED	
NO BUT I WOULD HAVE TO GUESS THAT THIS FUNCTION AND INVOKES SINCE HAS ALREADY BEEN IT REALLY MATTER WHAT VALUE RETURNVALUE TAKES ON IN THE FINALLY THIS BEHAVIOUR KIND OF MAKES BECAUSE IT SUPPOSED TO EXECUTE THE ENTIRE TRY BLOCK BEFORE THE FINALLY AND THE ONLY WAY IT CAN DO THAT IS IF IT RETURNS FROM THE FUNCTION LIKE ITS SUPPOSED	
NO COMMENT	
NO EASY WAY AROUND THIS IN AT THE YOU COULD EXTRACT THE ONLY OF IN AN INTERFACE AND LET YOUR PROPERTY RETURN THAT INSTEAD OF	
NO EXPERT AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT OUTPUT BUFFERING AS TO DO WITH MAYBE THERE ARE SOME ERRORS IN THE YOU CREATE AN FILE WITH THE FOLLOWING IT IN THE ROOT FOLDER OF THAT SITE AND THEN TRY TO LOG IN AGAIN TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY OUTPUT	
NO GENERAL METHOD OF CAPTURING THE VARIABLES FOR PRETTY MUCH ASKING THAT A DUMP BE TAKEN WHENEVER YOU GET AN EVEN HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE USER HAD BEEN DOING BEFORE THE ERROR YOU CAN GET HELP FROM THE IIS LOGS YOU SHOULD ALSO LOG THE REFERRER URL IF TRUE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM IS A HARD BETTER THE FEWER ERRORS THAT HAPPEN ONCE GONE THE FEWER HAVE TO FIGURE NUMBER OF ERRORS FOUND IN QA CAN BE FURTHER REDUCED BY FINDING THEM THROUGH AUTOMATED UNIT ESPECIALLY USING

NO OTHER WAY OF EXECUTING ARBITRARY SOURCE CODE OTHER THAN COMPILING IT INTO ASSEMBLY AND THEN EXECUTING ANDERS HEJLSBERG OF ANNOUNCED PLANS TO EXPOSE THE COMPILER AS A SERVICE A SET OF CLR SO THIS MIGHT BE OF SOME HELP WHEN THIS AS A BASICALLY MEANS THAT YOU CAN COMPILE AN ARBITRARY PIECE OF CODE INTO EXPRESSION BETTER INTO AN AST AND GENERALLY GET HOLD OF INTERNAL COMPILER	
NO OTHER WAY OF STORING 5GB OF DATA ON FAT32 THAN SPLITTING IT IN A ROUTINE THAT WILL DEAL WITH ARCHIVES OF MORE THAN SPLIT AND ENCAPSULATE IT IN SOME UTIL CLASS OR UTIL FILE AND CALL IT FROM YOUR

NOT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE REGULAR PYTHON STRING IF YOU HAVE A STRING CONTAINING A BACKSLASH OR A DOUBLE FOR PYTHON WILL OFTEN PRINT IT IN ESCAPED TO MAKE THE PRINTED STRING A VALID STRING FOLLOWING SNIPPET PRINT SURE IF THIS IS PERHAPS SOMEONE WITH MORE DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE CAN CHIME	
NOT CALL IT BEFORE YOU CALL YOUR CODE SHOULD PROBABLY BE STRUCTURED SO ONLY CALLING FROM ONE PLACE RETURNING FROM EITHER WAY THAT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO

NOT CLEAR WHETHER YOU MEAN ACTUAL OLE DOCUMENTS WITH OR JUST AUTOMATION INTO THE PROGRAMMING MODELS OF OFFICE YOU CAN DO OLE WITH VISUAL EXPRESS YOU JUST HAVE THE BENEFITS OF MFC TO HELP YOU DO YOU HAVE ATL WHICH IS NOT AS BAD AS BUT NEITHER IS THAT PROBLEM WITH OLE IS UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF LIBRARY TO BASE YOUR WORK YOU WILL HAVE TO CRANK OUT A LOT OF BOILERPLATE NEED TO REFER TO SOME FOR A TEST WHY NOT USE	
NOT COMPLETE RIGHT NOW JUST MOCKED IT UP REALLY BUT A WAY OF DOING IT USING STRAIGHT YOU WANT THREE TABLES TWO OUTSIDE THE AND ONE INSIDE THE ALL THREE ARE FLOATED TO THE SO THAT ALL ON THE SAME THE CODE THE ON THE DIV IS SO THAT THE SCROLLBAR DOES NOT COVER UP THE TABLE IN THE BUG I HAVE TO WORK OUT IS HOW TO SPECIFY THE WIDTH OF THE HEADER ELEMENTS INSIDE THE MIDDLE FOR SOME SPECIFYING THE ATTRIBUTE DOES NOT IF THE TEXT OF THE HEADER ELEMENT IS TOO WIDE BREAKS ONTO ANOTHER THEN THE LAYOUT IS BROKEN BY ONE

NOT GOING TO HAVE A COMPLETE SOLUTION HERE FOR YOU WANTED TO START WITH REALLY RECOMMEND USING SOME KIND OF GENERATED DATA ACCESS LINQ TO SQL OR NHIBERNATE ARE BUT THOSE TWO ARE BOTH PRETTY THE CODE YOU ARE SAYING YOU WILL BE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN IS CODE YOU REALLY HAVE TO LET SOMEBODY ELSE DO THE GRUNT WORK AN SAY YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING WITH SPLITTING UP ALL OF THE DATA INTO SEPARATE CLASSES THAT IMPLEMENT ONE THING MENTION THOUGH WITH YOU NEED TO MAKE EXPLICIT USE A PROPERTY WITH A PUBLIC LOOK SOMETHING LIKE CLASS NAME PRIVATE STRING PRIVATE STRING PRIVATE STRING PRIVATE STRING PUBLIC STRING LASTNAME GET RETURN AUTOMATIC PUBLIC STRING FIRSTNAME PROTECTED	
NOT GOING TO REPEAT WHAT WAS ALREADY MENTIONED BUT ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE IS USING THE APPLICATION IT SHOULD BE USED SINCE IT WILL CONSUME MEMORY ON YOUR WEB SERVER AS ADAM HAS ALREADY BUT IT DOES PROVIDE A GOOD WAY TO CACHE THINGS THAT ARE COMMON ACROSS ALL YOUR KEEPS YOU FROM HAVING TO GO BACK TO YOUR DATABASE TO RETRIEVE INFORMATION THAT MOST LIKELY WAS ALREADY ASKED FOR BY SOMEONE ALTERNATIVE SIMILAR TO APPLICATION IS CACHE WHICH HAS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF WHEN IT GETS SOME LINKS IN CASE NET	
NOT GONNA WRITE WHAT IT FORGET THAT YOU EVER SAW THIS	
NOT GREAT FOR PROVIDING SPECIFIC USAGE HERE IS A LINK FROM MSDN WHICH LISTS ALL THE FEATURES FOR THE IS A DECENT FLOW CHART THAT CAN HELP CHOOSING BETWEEN THEM AS IS A GOOD OVERALL ARTICLE USED IN THE IN THE WAYBACK MACHINE IF THE LINK NO LONGER WORKS FOR	
NOT HOW DEEP MY TREE WILL SO I THINK THE NSM IS FIT FOR READING SOME IN THIS MODEL SUPPOSE USING AN INTEGER VALUE AS PRIMARY I THOUGHT TO CREATE A TWIN TABLE ONLY TO STORE THE INTS CONNECTED BY A RELATION WITH THE REAL THINGS ARE COMPLICATING AND IT IS A WASTE OF SPACE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SERVER IS NOT MINE AND I HAVE TO PAY EACH THANKS MACKA AND I COULD SKIP READING A WHOLE FOR IS A FUTURE ORDER ON LIKE TO USE THE SET BUT OBLIGED TO HAVE A GUID AS PRIMARY HOW CAN I DO WITHOUT INTEGERS AS	
NOT IN FOR AN APPLICATION WORKING I TO TARGET X86 IT BRINGS IN COM FOR WHICH THE VENDOR SUPPORT	
NOT INSTEAD PASS THE JAVASCRIPT DATE AS A STRING AND THEN CONVERT IT TO A DATE TYPE IN FUNCTION D AS AS RETURN OPTION IS TO USE CTYPE IS A LEXICAL CAST THAT WILL TRY A VARIETY OF WAYS TO CONVERT THE STRING VALUE TO A NOT TERRIBLY FAMILIAR WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A JAVASCRIPT DATE AND A DATE IN TERMS OF BUT IF YOU POST AN EXAMPLE SURE WE CAN GET A BASIC CONVERSION

NOT JUST ADD AN UNDERSCORE OR SINGLE LETTER PREFIX FOR YOUR PRIVATE MEMBER YOU LIKE THAT WHAT DONE IN YOUR SECOND CODE BLOCK IS	
NOT JUST CHECK IF THEN DO YOUR PROCESSING ON IT WOULD STILL ONLY FIRE ON IF YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THE ELEMENT EXISTS AS JUST SLAP THAT INTO THE I VAR D I	
NOT JUST KEEP A COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF MOMENTS THE HUMAN PLAYER ATTACK THE COMPUTER I YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO CHECK TO SEE IF IN SO WHY NOT CHECK WHETHER IN AND IF HE INCREMENT THE THEN IF HE ACTUALLY DOES INCREMENT AN THEN YOU CAN COMPARE HOW OFTEN THE HUMAN PLAYER ATTACKS TO HOW OFTEN HE HAS THE COMPARE HOW OFTEN HE IS IN RANGE TO HOW OFTEN HE IS NOT IN OR MORE GENERALLY KEEP TRACK OF THE AVERAGE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE MORE AGGRESSIVE PLAYERS WILL PROBABLY STAY A LOT CLOSER TO THEIR OPPONENTS THAN PASSIVE BEST BET WILL PROBABLY BE A COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT KEEP SEVERAL DIFFERENT AND TRY SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS OF WEIGHING THE METHODS AGAINST EACH AND USE EXTENSIVE PLAYTESTING TO PICK WHICH ONE IS	
NOT JUST LEAVE IT IN THE WEBFORM AND REFACTOR TO A USERCONTROL WHEN YOU REUSE THAT CODE GETS BETTER BUT THERE IS ALSO A BALANCE TO BE STRUCK WITH THE AMOUNT OF YOUR PROJECT HAS IF YOU GO IT CAN GET DAUNTING TO FIND	
NOT JUST REMOVE THE	
NOT JUST THE TRUNK WITH AND CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT IN THE SAME THIS WAY YOU AVOID THE DOUBLE BRANCH ALTOGETHER AND STILL MAINTAIN WAYS TO GET TO THE OLD VERSION OF YOUR UNLESS DEVELOPING A DIFFERENT YOU LIKELY WANT TO KEEP THE SAME	
NOT OR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT COOKIES ARE STORED ON COMPUTERS SO FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW A WEBSITE BASICALLY OUT IN THE POTENTIALLY ACCESSIBLE TO COMMON PRACTICE IS TO JUST STORE A SESSION ID IN A AND STORE ALL OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION IN A DATABASE OR ON THE INDEXED BY SESSION	
NOT PACKAGE THE FUNCTION IN ITS OWN DLL THEN DISTRIBUTE IT WITH THE WINDOWS SERVICE AND THE WEB SERVICE	
NOT PERSONAL USING TO CONDUCT PROFESSIONAL THE FREELANCER WILL HAVE TO

NOT REALLY SURE I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND YOUR WHAT I THINK YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY IS THAT WHEN YOU DRAG A SUPPOSED TO BE BINDING A CLICK EVENT LISTENER TO THE BUTTON ON YOUR PORTLET SO THAT WHEN CLICKED A DIALOG POPS YOU ARE SAYING THAT WHEN YOU CLICK ON THAT A DIALOG POPS UP FOR YOUR PORTLETS AND NOT JUST THE ONE YOU CLICKED THE BUTTON INSIDE THE IT MAY BE THAT YOU ARE BINDING THAT WRENCH MULTIPLE TIMES SO THAT WHEN ITS IT WILL ACT AS IF ITS CLICKED MORE THAN THE ONLY RECOMMENDATION I HAVE FOR YOU IS THAT INSTEAD OF USING THE METHOD USE THE IS WHAT I DO DO STUFF THIS INSTEAD AND SEE IF IT MAKES ANY DO STUFF THAT LET ME KNOW AND I WILL SEE IF I CAN HELP YOU SO I THINK I MIGHT UNDERSTAND YOUR PROBLEM WHEN THAT WRENCH GETS IT BRINGS UP A DIALOG AND IN THAT DIALOG YOU ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE CHANGES TO A CERTAIN YOU KNOW HOW TO LET THE DIALOG BOX KNOW WHAT PORTLET IT SHOULD BE AFFECTING ON ON THAT YOU CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE VAR SOME OF YOUR STUFF VAR VAR DO STUFF WITH FOR OR WHATEVER YOU WANTED TO THE REST OF YOUR BUTTONS AND YOUR	
NOT REPLACE ALL THAT UNSAFE STUFF WITH STATIC BITMAP RETURN NEW	
NOT RESOLVE THE IP BEFORE START TO LOAD THE	
NOT SELECTING ANYTHING FROM THE SECOND ADD IT LATER BUT IT WORK THIS WAY	
NOT SIMPLY USE THE BUILT IN CLASS ASSUMING YOU ARE USING AT LEAST JAVA	
NOT SOMETHING I WOULD USUALLY WRITE TESTS BUT YOU COULD SIMPLY CREATE A SET OF TEST CLASSES WHICH USE AND ABUSE THE TO TEST THAT IT IS STORING ITS MEMBER THAT IT HAS THE CORRECT DEFAULTS WILL ONLY WORK ON RUNTIME ANNOTATIONS THAT ARE SPECFIED ON THE CORRECT TARGETS OF MY ANNOTATIONS THEMSELVES ARE RARELY INTERESTING ENOUGH TO WARRANT UNIT TESTS IT IS USUALLY THE CODE WHICH USES THEM THAT NEEDS BUT THEN NOT FROM THE CODE COVERAGE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT	
NOT SUPER FAMILIAR WITH RHINOMOCKS BEEN USING BUT ALSO THINK YOU NEED A WITH	
NOT SURE ABOUT A TOOL BUT TAKE A LOOK AT CAN DRAW A GRID OF ALL THE INPUTS AND OUTPUT TO TRY AND FIND A MINIMAL BOOLEAN	
NOT SURE ABOUT BUT HOW YOU WOULD DO IT IN HAVE A CLASS THAT EXTENDS THREAD IMPLEMENTS AND A CONSTRUCTOR WITH THE PARAMETERS LIKE TO WHEN YOU CREATE THE NEW YOU HAVE TO PASS IN THE AND THEN START THE SOMETHING LIKE T NEW BE THE SAME IN YOUR VAJNA	
NOT SURE ABOUT MOST OF YOUR BUT ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT YOU HAVE TO UPDATE EVERYTIME THE NEW VERSION COMES WAIT A LITTLE WHILE AND PROBABLY THANK YOURSELF OK TO CHANGE VERSIONS AT HOME TO SCREW AROUND WITH IT BUT IF YOU DO IT COMMERCIALLY IT COULD BE A REAL PAIN IN THE MICROSOFT MADE ME LEARN THIS THE HARD	
NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT YOU BUT HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE CAN THAT YOU CAN REVERSE THE NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAN A SINCE AFAIK LONGS IN PYTHON ARE UNBOUNDED BY YOU CAN DEAL WITH BIGGER INTEGERS BY JUST DIVIDING AND N TARGET S WHILE N R S S THAT MATCHES THE RESULT OF	
NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT YOUR CAN YOU TRY CLARIFYING THE SCENARIO A IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE A CONTROLS ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS MAKE THAT CONTROL A CHILD OF THE PANEL USING THE CONTROLS SHOULD UPDATE THE PARENT OF TARGET TO BE ATTEMPTING TO DO THIS VIA THE ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS DRAG THE TARGET CONTROL ONTO THE PANEL AND THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF	
NOT SURE HOW BEST TO CODE IT IN BUT A COMMON TECHNIQUE TO IMPROVE SPEED ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD BE TO USE IN A THE IDEA IS TO CACHE THE RESULT OF FOR EVERY P OR POSSIBLY THE LAST N SO THAT NEXT TIME YOU CALL THE SAVED RESULT IS RATHER THAN BEING IN THE CACHE WOULD BE A MAP FROM A TUPLE THE INPUT TO THE RETURN	
NOT SURE HOW PHOTOSHOP IMPLEMENTS BUT THE PAINT NODE WITHIN COMPOSITING APPLICATION IS PRETTY EASY TO STOKE IS STORED AS A SERIES OF ALONG WITH SOME INFORMATION LIKE YOU DRAW A THE CHANGES ARE MADE ON THE CURRENT STROKES I THE CURRENT IMAGE IS CACHED INTO YOU IT REDRAWS THE LAST STOKES ON THE PREVIOUS CACHED ARE TWO PROBLEMS WITH YOU UNDO MORE THAN 10 IT HAS TO RECALCULATE THE WHOLE WITH THOUSANDS OF STROKES THIS CAN CAUSE A SEVERAL SECOND YOU SAVE THE SETUP CONTAINING THE STROKE INFORMATION NOT THE ACTUAL PIXEL THEN MEANS YOU HAVE TO RECALCULATE THE WHOLE IMAGE WHENEVER YOU REOPEN THE PAINT OR RENDER THE IMAGE NEARLY AS BIG A PROBLEM AS THE UNDO THERE IS A THIRD THAT BEING SHAKE IS HORRIBLY BUGGY AND POORLY IMPLEMENTED IN MANY THE PAINT NODE BEIGN ONE OF THEM SO NOT SURE HOW GOOD AN IMPLEMENTATION THIS BUT I IMAGINE PHOTOSHOP BEING TOO DISSIMILAR BETTER	
NOT SURE I AM FULLY BUT WHEN YOU CREATE AN EVENT YOU CAN SAY THAT IT BUBBLES AND SO WHEN IT DISPATCHES IT WILL BELIEVE THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO ATTACH AN EVENT LISTENER TO YOUR CITY FOR THE RIGHT TYPES OF EVENTS AND THAT WOULD CATCH EVENTS THROWN BY I EVER TRIED THIS THOUGH SO I AM NOT I REALIZE YOU ARE FROM THE FOLLOWING AND BUBBLING HAPPEN AS THE EVENT OBJECT MOVES FROM NODE TO NODE IN THE DISPLAY FOR CAPTURING AND FOR THIS PROCESS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INHERITANCE ONLY DISPLAYOBJECT OBJECTS OBJECTS SUCH AS CONTAINERS AND CAN HAVE A CAPTURING PHASE AND A BUBBLING PHASE IN ADDITION TO THE TARGETING ONLY WAY I CAN SEE AROUND THIS WOULD BE FOR YOU TO REGISTER THE CHILD WITH THE PARENT CAR WITH THE EVERY TIME A NEW ONE IS ADDED AS A AT THAT POINT YOU COULD ADD AN EVENT LISTENER IN THE PARENT AND THEN AN EVENT FROM THE PARENT ANY TIME A EVENT IS HANDLED FROM THE CHILD ITS UGLY I AND YOU WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE THE EVENT LISTENER ANYTIME THAT YOU REMOVE A BUT THE ONLY REAL SOLUTION I CAN

NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR ANSWER ABIZERN SO LET ME SAY YOU USE ON A PROPERTY YOU WILL BE MAKING A WHOLE NEW COPY OF THAT OBJECT SO WOULD BE WASTING A LOT OF NOT SURE WHY THEY ARE DOING THEY COULD JUST USE INSTEAD IF THEY WANT TO PROTECT THE VALUES FROM PLUS REMEMBER MOST VALUE CLASSES ARE IMMUTABLE IN SO THEY CHANGE THE VALUE	
NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR THIS STANDART YOU WILL OMIT THE IN YOUR ROUTE AND HARDCODE IT TO A DEFAULT FOR THE SPECIFIC

REALIZE THIS IS REALLY BUT JUST GETTING STARTED SO I THOUGHT STICK MY TWO CENTS TELLS YOU IF THE USER IS GIVES YOU THE IDENTITY OF THE	
REALLY A HARD AND FAST RULE FOR THIS TYPE OF THING MOST EXPERIMENTS LIKE TO USE AT LEAST 200 MEMBERS IN A POPULATION AT THE BAREST SCALING UP TO MILLIONS OR THE NUMBER OF GENERATIONS IS USUALLY IN THE 100 TO IN TO ANSWER YOUR FINAL BETTER TO HAVE LOTS OF MEMBERS IN THE POPULATION SO THAT GENES STAY IN A POPULATION LONG ENOUGH TO AND THEN USE A SMALLER NUMBER OF THESE THE IMPORTANT MOST CRITICAL PART OF ANY GA IS THE FITNESS IF YOU HAVE A DECENT FITNESS FUNCTION THAT ACCURATELY EVALUATES WHAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A LEVEL OR A NOT GOING TO END UP WITH INTERESTING RESULTS NO MATTER HOW MANY GENERATIONS YOU OR HOW BIG YOUR POPULATION IS	
REALLY BE STORING THE AGE WITHIN THE DATABASE AS IT IS EASILY CALCULATED AND CHANGES ON A DAILY WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU KEEP THE DATE OF BIRTH FIELD AND JUST CALCULATE THE AGE AS YOU NEED IF YOU WISH TO HAVE THE AGE SELECTED ALONG WITH THE OTHER ATTRIBUTES THEN CONSIDER A PERHAPS WITH A USER DEFINED FUNCTION TO CALCULATE THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXAMPLE UDF THAT YOU COULD FUNCTION AGE DECLARE SELECT FROM WHERE USERID RETURN WITHIN YOUR QUERIES YOU CAN DO SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE AS ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION ON SORTING THEN YOU COULD CREATE A VIEW ON THE DATA AND USE THAT TO SHOW THE DATA SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS VIEW AS CAN THEN USE THIS VIEW TO PERFORM YOUR THERE COULD BE A PERFORMANCE HIT FOR FILTERING AND SORTING BASED ON THE AGE AND IF YOU REGULARLY BASED UPON THE AGE FIELD THEN YOU MAY WANT TO CREATE AN INDEXED	
REALLY DEPENDS ON THE THE THE DATA YOU AND THE TYPES OF THERE IS NO GREAT WAY TO ANSWER THIS WITHOUT MORE	
REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE OF THE AS WELL AS YOUR CONCERN REGARDING TWO APPLICATIONS RUN INSIDE THE SAME APPLICATION POOL THEY HAVE THE SAME SECURITY SO THERE IS A SECURITY CONCERN HERE FOR SOME AS IN THEORY EACH COULD HAVE ACCESS TO FILES OF THE IF ONE SITE STARTS HAVING ISSUES AND USING MEMORY IT COULD CAUSE RECYCLES OR FREEZES THAT COULD IMPACT THERE IS NOT A AND RULE TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I CONSIDER AND THAT CAUSE DECISIONS FOR ME ARE THE THE APPLICATION MISSION SEPARATE APP THIS A THIRD PARTY AND UNSURE OF WHAT ALL IT SEPARATE APP THIS APPLICATION SEE MAJOR SPIKES IN IT MIGHT BE BEST TO IS A LOT OUT BUT THE KEYS ARE ISOLATION AND ABILITY TO TROUBLESHOOT SINGLE HERE IS A THAT TOUCHES ON IT A BIT AS

REALLY DO ANYTHING A WAY TO SUPPRESS COMPILER MOANING ABOUT OF THE KEYWORD IS A COMPILER THE COMPILER KNOWS WHAT TO DO IN THIS CASE AND CARE ABOUT OF THE	
REALLY DO IT FOR ALL MODES AS THERE ARE INDENTATION BUT YOU CAN SET IT IT FOR ALL OF THE LANGUAGES YOU CARE FOR SOMETHING AKIN TO THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SHOULD WORK FOR WHAT YOU WILL SET UP TAB STOPS AT 4 CHARACTERS AND MAKE 4 THE DEFAULT INDENTATION LEVEL FOR ALL FOR OTHER LANGUAGES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE YOU HAVE TO LOOK UP THEIR INDENTATION VARIABLES AND SET THEM ACCORDINGLY IN THAT COMMON SOME EXAMPLES INCLUDE AND THE EASIEST WAY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE SET IS TO SHOULD SEND YOU DOWN THE RABBIT	
REALLY DOUBT THAT YOU WANT TO BE USING WHICH IS SPECIFIC TO YOUR ASIDE FROM WHY NOT USE THE MORE STANDARD WAY OF DOING NAMELY GZIP THE BINARY DATA INSTEAD OF DOING TEXT I SUSPECT THAT WILL HAVE MORE AND NEARLY AS FRAGILE IN TERMS OF ACCIDENTALLY BREAKING THE IN YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE ENCODING ANY

REALLY IS NO EQUIVALENT IN HAS ONLY 2 WAYS TO INITIALIZE INSTANCE THE EXPLICITLY INITIALIZING THE VARIABLE AT DECLARATION IS NO WAY TO DO AN INITIALIZATION AFTER THE OBJECT IS CREATED BUT BEFORE THE CONSTRUCTOR	
REALLY LIKE THE PHP FUNCTION BUT THE GIVE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPORTED DATE IT ONLY GIVES A FEW EXAMPLES LIKE SEPTEMBER WEEK 2 DAYS 4 HOURS 2 AND CAN I FIND A COMPLETE DATE FORMATS DOES THE PHP FUNCTION	
REALLY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DECORATE MY CLASS WITH AN ATTRIBUTE OF SOME SORT THAT WOULD ENFORCE THE USE OF A USING STATEMENT SO THAT THE CLASS WILL ALWAYS BE SAFELY DISPOSED AND AVOID MEMORY ANYONE KNOW OF SUCH A IT POSSIBLE TO ENFORCE THE USE OF A USING STATEMENT IN	
REALLY LOOKED AT THE BUT I KNOW THE PROJECT USES PRETTY STRICT AGILE DEVELOPMENT IN THIS CASE BOB MARTIN MIGHT BE SORT OF A BENEVOLENT DICTATOR WHO OVERSEES THE BUT USING A LOT OF AGILE PRACTICES LIKE NOT SURE IF USING SCRUM SPECIFICALLY	
REALLY LOVE THE IDEA OF IT AS I CAN CREATE A FOLDER FOR MY USER AND MAKE SUB FOLDER AND PUT LOCAL RESOURCE SO THE WHOLE THING IS CONTAINED IN ONE AND THAT MAKES IT REALLY EFFICIENT FOR ME THE BUGGER IS YOU CANT GET INTELLISENCE LIKE GLOBAL SO IS IT POSSIBLE IN ANY WAY TO GET STRONLY TYPED LOCAL RESOURCE	
REALLY MEANT FOR THIS CONDITIONAL COMPILATION AND IT HONESTLY SOUNDS LIKE A RECIPE FOR ENDING UP IN YOU COULD MANUALLY START DEALING WITH FUNCTIONS THAT RETURN THE VERSION OF YOUR YOU THEN HAVE A CLASSFILE THAT FITS A SPECIFIC BUT WITH NO INDICATIONS THAT IT MAY BE ENCOUNTERED THIS SITUATION BEFORE WORKING WITH DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF AND NOT WHAT I ENDED UP DOING IS HAVING AN INTERFACE WITH TWO DIFFERENT ONE FOR EACH PUT EACH OF THEM IN A SEPARATE PROJECT IN MY AND THEN TRIED TO LOAD THEM WITH A FACTORY OR AN ISOLATE THEM AS WELL AS YOU	
REALLY OPPOSED TO MERELY YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE AND RUN IT YOURSELF IT THE ORIGINAL PROVIDER GOES OF WANT TO DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE AHEAD OF BECAUSE IF THE SERVICE PROVIDER GOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THERE WILL BE A SITE TO DOWNLOAD IT PROBABLY WANT TO KEEP BACKUPS OF THE DATA FOR YOURSELF IF YOU IF MISUSING THE TERM TO MEAN A FREE SERVICE LIKE THE GOOGLE MAPS THEN IF IT GOES BUT IF GOOGLE MAPS GOES SO IS HALF THE	
REALLY OUGHT TO GET A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE VIA A REPOSITORY AND IDENTIFYING YOUR DEPENDENCIES UP USING THE SYSTEM SCOPE IS A COMMON MISTAKE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT THE DEPENDENCY THE TROUBLE IS THAT DOING THIS YOU END UP WITH A PERVERTED MAVEN BUILD THAT WILL NOT SHOW MAVEN IN A NORMAL YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF FOLLOWING AN APPROACH LIKE	
REALLY SHOULD CHECK OUT THIS IS A GREAT LEARNING I WISH I HAD HAD SOMETHING THIS COOL WHEN I GOT SMALL ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU FIND A	
REALLY SHOULD CONSIDER USING A JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY LIKE OR THIS WILL HELP TO GET THE BROWSER SPECIFIC CODE OUT OF THE THE VISIBILITY ON THE STATE OF THE RATHER THAN JUST TOGGLING IS PROBABLY A BETTER STYLE IN THIS SITUATION INSTEAD OF IF YOU USE THEN YOU WILL JUST GET A BLANK AREA WHERE THE SHOULD BE WHEN OF A YOU PROBABLY WANT TO PASS IN THE ID OF THE DIV TAG AND THE ID OF THE IN WOULD BE YOUR IS THE AREA YOU WANT TO IS YOUR	
REALLY SHOULD TRY TO GOOGLE HAS A OF LEAP THE YOUR DESCRIBING IS FOR THE GREGORIAN ABOUT THE MATH AROUND IT CAN BE FOUND IN THE ARTICLE	
REALLY SOUNDS LIKE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE ORIGINS OF THE IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT BE EASY TO WHY IS IT VISIBLE AT ITS REALLY WHY IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO POST IT ON THE THAT AN INTERNAL WEBPAGE WOULD BE MORE	
REALLY THINK TAKING THE HARD ROUTE WITH THIS I DO THAT KIND OF OPERATIONS AND USE FOR THAT KIND OF THING OTHER ALTERNATIVES ARE DOES ITS JOB SEE ONE GOOD REASON FOR WASTING TIME WITH WRITING A NEW BATCH FILE FOR	
REALLY TO CALL THE METHODS OF THE BASE BUT YOU USUALLY TO DO IT BECAUSE THE BASE CLASSES WILL DO SOME IMPORTANT INITIALIZATIONS THERE THAT ARE NEEDED FOR REST OF THE CLASSES METHODS TO OTHER METHODS IT DEPENDS ON YOUR IF YOU JUST WANT TO ADD SOMETHING TO THE BASE CLASSES BEHAVIOR YOU WILL WANT TO CALL THE BASE CLASSES METHOD ADDITIONALLY TO YOUR OWN IF YOU WANT TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE YOU MIGHT NOT CALL THE BASE METHOD AND IMPLEMENT ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY DIRECTLY IN THE DERIVED	
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT CONFLICT ASKING NOR THE PROBLEM WITH THE FINE TO HAVE TWO INDEPENDENT HANDLES TO THE SAME THING I KNOW THAT I LEARNED IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION IT THAT THERE IS A NEW METHOD ON RAISES A NEW EXCEPTION INSIDE THE GENERATOR TO TERMINATE THE ON RECEIVING THIS THE CODE MUST EITHER RAISE OR IS CALLED WHEN A GENERATOR IS SO THIS MEANS THE CODE GETS ONE LAST CHANCE TO RUN BEFORE THE GENERATOR IS THIS LAST CHANCE MEANS THAT STATEMENTS IN GENERATORS CAN NOW BE GUARANTEED TO THE CLAUSE WILL NOW ALWAYS GET A CHANCE TO THIS SEEMS LIKE A MINOR BIT OF LANGUAGE BUT USING GENERATORS AND IS ACTUALLY NECESSARY IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE STATEMENT DESCRIBED BY PEP THAT HANDLES THE SITUATION WHERE A STATEMENT IS USED IN A BUT IT YIELDS IN THE MIDDLE BUT NEVER CONTEXT METHOD WILL BE CALLED WHEN THE GENERATOR IS REGARDS TO THE FILE HANDLE I SOMETIMES FORGET THAT THERE EXIST PLATFORMS THAT FAR AS LOCKS I THINK DOWGIRD HITS THE HEAD ON THE NAIL HE JUST HAVE TO BE AWARE THAT THE GENERATOR IS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER OBJECT THAT HOLDS I THINK THE STATEMENT IS REALLY THAT RELEVANT SINCE THIS FUNCTION SUFFERS FROM THE SAME DEADLOCK YIELD YIELD	
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT DOING AT BUT THIS SEEMS TO	
REALLY USE COMPOUND THE JOINING TABLES STILL HAVE TO HAVE AN ID IN THEM FOR ATOMIC DELETES AND I THINK EVERYONE ELSE HAS SAID THE SAME THING BUT IN A MORE ROUNDABOUT	
REALLY WANT THE MERGE INCLUDED THE BNF FOR THE MERGE STATEMENT FROM THE STANDARD BUT THE SQL STANDARD FOR WHEN THAT MIGHT TRANSLATE INTO USING TABLEB ON WHEN NOT MATCHED INSERT HAVE NOT RUN THAT PAST AN SQL DBMS THAT KNOWS ABOUT THE MERGE STATEMENT THAT MEANS THERE ARE PROBABLY BUGS IN NOTE THAT THERE IS A WHEN MATCHED CLAUSE WHICH CAN TAKE AN UPDATE IN THE IBM DB2 ALSO SUPPORTS A DELETE CLAUSE WHICH IS NOT IN THE 2003 STANDARD SURE ABOUT THE 2008 UPDATE ROWS OF A OR INSERT NEW ROWS INTO A OR MERGE INTO AS CORRELATION USING ON OPERATION CORRELATION OPERATION WHEN WHEN WHEN MATCHED WHEN NOT MATCHED WHEN MATCHED WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE WHEN NOT MATCHED WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT UPDATE UPDATE SET CLAUSE INSERT INSERT COLUMN VALUES INSERT VALUE INSERT VALUE INSERT VALUE INSERT VALUE INSERT VALUE TYPED VALUE	
REALLY WANT TO FIND ALL OF THE POSSIBLE WISH TO FIND HOW MANY ELEMENTS IN AN ARRAY CAN BE COMBINED TO EQUAL A GIVEN AND SEE AS A STEP TOWARDS THE THEN QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE SUBSETS BECOMES RIDICULOUSLY LARGE VERY THEN YOU SHOULD SORT THE ARRAY FIRST AND WORK FROM	
REALLY WANT TO USE MOQ YOU JUST NEED TO USE SOME BASICALLY WRITE A TEST THAT CREATE AN INSTANCE OF YOUR SETS EACH CLONES AND THEN MAKES SURE THAT EACH PROPERTY IS EQUAL ON THE PAUL CHECK OUT THAT BASICALLY DOES THIS FOR OR AT LEAST IMPLEMENT ICLONEABLE WHICH IS A STANDARD PRACTICE FOR HOW TO DO ONLY DOES A SHALLOW COPY WHICH IS WHY YOU MIGHT NEED TO IMPLEMENT THEN YOU COULD EVEN WRITE A TEST THAT LOOKS THROUGH YOUR ASSEMBLY FOR EVERYTHING THAT IMPLEMENTS ICLONEABLE AND TESTS	
REALLY YOU CAN USE SELECT TO INITIALIZE A SELECT 1	
REASON BEHIND THIS IS THAT THE DATAGRID SUPPORTS UI VIRTUALIZATION AND THE LISTBOX DOES THIS MEANS THAT THE DATAGRID ONLY CREATES VISUAL ELEMENTS FOR THE VISIBLE ITEMS WHILE THE LISTBOX CREATES VISUAL ELEMENTS FOR ALL OF ITS YOU HAVE TO SELECT FROM A LIST OF ITEMS THAT CAN BE VERY USE THE DATAGRID INSTEAD OF THE YOU CAN STYLE THE DATAGRID AND USE THE TEMPLATECOLUMN TO MAKE IT LOOK JUST LIKE A	
REASON BEING THAT I SUSPECT MOST PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT TO IMPLEMENT IT USING A CLASS AND A THE FOLLOWING HASKELL SORTBY COMPARE SORTBY SORTBY THE STRATEGY PATTERN IN AND ARE THE CONCRETE STRATEGIES IN THIS CASE PLAIN OLD AND THE FUNCTION SIGNATURE A IS THE STRATEGY BREVITY OF THIS ILLUSTRATES THAT DESIGN PATTERNS HAVE TO BE SO HEAVYWEIGHT OR THE WAY YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGY IN JAVA IS A GOOD A WAY THAT WORKS AROUND JAVA GIVING YOU THE WRONG ABSTRACTIONS FOR THE JOB YOU NEED TO THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED NORMAL OR THAT ASSUMING MY ASSUMPTION ABOUT THE WAY TAUGHT IS I LIKE THE STRATEGY PATTERN VERY ARE SOME OF OTHER PATTERNS WHICH ARE ALSO SPECIFIC INSTANCES OF THE GENERAL I LIKE THEM VERY MUCH FOR VERY MUCH THE SAME	
REASON FOR THAT SIMPLY WOULD TRY	
REASON SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND IS NOT BECAUSE A DIFFICULT CONCEPT BUT BECAUSE SYNTAX IS INT ARE FIRST LEARNED THAT THE LEFTMOST PART OF A VARIABLE CREATION DEFINES THE TYPE OF THE POINTER DECLARATION DOES NOT WORK LIKE THIS IN C AND INSTEAD THEY SAY THAT THE VARIABLE IS POINTING ON THE TYPE TO THE IN THIS ON AN FULLY GRASP POINTERS UNTIL I TRIED USING THEM IN THEY WORK IN EXACT SAME WAY BUT WITH LOGICAL AND CONSISTENT THE POINTER IS A TYPE HERE A POINTER TO AN EVEN GET ME STARTED ON FUNCTION	
REASON THAT MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL SWITCHED FROM SLIVERLIGHT TO FLASH IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCH BASEBALL AT WORK THEY HAD TROUBLE GETTING SILVERLIGHT INSTALLED BECAUSE PCS IN A CORPORATE ENVIRONMENT ARE TYPICALLY LOCKED DOWN AND USERS INSTALL SOFTWARE ON BUT ALMOST ALL PCS HAVE FLASH ARTICLE	
REASON THIS IS HAPPENING IS BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR TO RESTORED POSTED THOSE CONTROLS NEED TO BE A PART OF THE PAGE BEFORE IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS WORK YOU NEED TO CREATE YOUR CONTROLS ONINIT OF THE	
REASON TO DELETE IS TO AVOID FALSE ALARMS FROM A LEAK DETECTOR YOU MAY USE IN IF YOU HAVE FALSE ALARMS YOU MAY NOT PAY ATTENTION TO A REAL LEAK REPORTED BY A LEAK DETECTOR IT WILL BE BURRIED AMONG THE FALSE ONES IN THE THERE IS AN ALMOST IDENTICAL ANSWER THAT APPEARED WHILE I WAS WRITING THIS	
REASON WHY IS THAT BY THE TIME THAT CODE IS THE FILE STREAM HAS BEEN CLOSED INSIDE OF THE USING STATEMENT CLOSES THE ORIGINAL INPUT STREAM AND THERE REMOVES THE STREAM AS	
REASON WHY IT IS NOT SAFE TO INSTANCIATE A VECTOR OF IS THAT THERE IS AN ALGORITHM THAT WILL DO A COPY OF ONE OBJECT IN YOUR CONTAINER ON THE IMPLEMENTS QUICKSORT WHICH NEEDS A THEREFORE DELETING IT WHEN GOING OUT OF SCPOPE OF THE WELL ANY OR FUNCTION OF YOUR OWN THAT ARE ABLE TO TAKE YOUR CONTAINER AS AND COPY ONE OF ITS OBJECT ON THE STACK WILL CAUSE THIS ISSUE AS A IN YOUR IT IS SIMPLE YOU MUST ENSURE YOUR CLASS DOES NOT BEHAVES AS AN OR ENSURE YOU WILL NEVER CALL SUCH THAT CAN DELETE YOUR UNDERLYING THE FIRST SOLUTION IS ACCORDING TO ME YOUR COPY CONSTRUCTOR AND YOUR AFFECTATION OPERATOR AS SHOULD NOT GIVE AWAY PROPERTY OF THE POINTER BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT IS TO WRAPP A BOOST SMART POINTER INSTEAD OF AN TO MAKE YOUR CONTAINER SAFE WHEN CALLING SUCH THE WAY ACCORDING TO DEFINING A BETTER COPY OPERATOR TO BYPASS THIS ISSUE IS NOT A GOOD I SEE A GOOD COPY CONSTRUCTOR IMPLEMENTATION AFFECTATION OPERATOR AS THAT COULD KEEP SAFE THE RESULT OF APPLYING THE	
REASON YOU ARE MARKING THOSE LINKS THAT BE VALIDATED AS OPPOSED TO THOSE THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER THE SECOND BUT IF YOU NEED TO STICK TO THIS THEN THE YOU COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE IS USING THE SELECTOR AND ONLY SELECTING LINKS THAT HAVE THE CLASS INTERNALLY JQUERY HAS TO GET ALL THE LINKS IN THE PAGE TO SEE WHETHER IT HAS THE CLASS OR WHICH IS NOT VERY YOU WOULD JUST GIVE A CLASS TO LINKS THAT BE THEN YOU CAN MUCH

THE EXAMPLE YOU YOU USING THE FOREACH METHOD IS JUST A NICE WAY TO ITERATE OVER THE ITEMS IN YOUR ENUMERABLE DATATYPE WITHOUT EXPLICITLY WRITING THE	
THE EXAMPLES YOU I THINK ACTUALLY ASKING WHAT THE IF IS THERE BETWEEN USING THE METHOD AND THEN THE DIFFERENCE DO STUFF AND DO STUFF ANSWER IS THAT IT REALLY A MATTER OF THE EVENT METHODS ARE SYNTACTICALLY SIMPLER AND INVOLVE LESS AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE REALLY ANY I PREFER TO USE THE BIND METHODS BECAUSE YOU CAN USE SHORTHAND EVENT BINDING IF YOU NEED TO ATTACH MORE THAN ONE EVENT TO THE SAME IT ALSO MAKES IT SIMPLER TO UNDERSTAND YOU NEED TO AN FROM WHAT THE ACTUAL QUESTION THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE METHOD AND THE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SHOULD NEVER REALLY USE THE METHOD TO ATTACH EVENTS BECAUSE THE AND METHODS USE THE QUICKER CSS SELECTOR ENGINE IT USES THE SIZZLE HARDLY EVER A CASE WHERE DO SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN DO STUFF

THINK BE BEST OF WHEN YOU USE THE GETKEYBOARDSTATE API STATIC EXTERN INT KEYSTATE VOID OBJECT KEYEVENTARGS E KEYS NEW GETKEYBOARDSTATE IF 128 ARROW KEY AND RIGHT ARROW KEY THE KEYDOWN YOU JUST ASK FOR THE OF THE GETKEYBOARDSTATE WILL POPULATE THE BYTE ARRAY THAT YOU AND EVERY ELEMENT IN THIS ARRAY REPRESENTS THE STATE OF A CAN ACCESS EACH KEYSTATE BY USING THE NUMERICAL VALUE OF EACH VIRTUAL KEY WHEN THE BYTE FOR THAT KEY IS SET TO 129 OR IT MEANS THAT THE KEY IS DOWN IF THE VALUE FOR THAT KEY IS 1 OR THE KEY IS UP THE VALUE 1 IS MEANT FOR TOGGLED KEY STATE CAPS LOCK DETAILS SEE MS DOCUMENTATION FOR

THINK BETTER OFF USING A SIMPLER MODEL WITH A ON COMMENT TO ALLOW FOR NESTING I THINK USUALLY A GOOD PRACTICE TO USE DATETIMES AS ESPECIALLY IN THIS WHERE YOU REALLY NEED AND AN IDENTITY ID WILL BE A BASIC EXAMPLE THAT MIGHT ALLOWS FOR NESTED	
THINK BOTH OF THEM ARE IF YOU ONLY MAKE YOUR CODE MORE WHEN FUN CASE WHEN FUN CASE CASE RESULT YOU THROW ERRORS OR RETURN I WOULD RETURN AN ERROR WE SPLIT OUT CODE OUT INTO MNESIA WORK UNITS A MODULE WITH A SET OF FUNCTIONS THAT PERFORM BASIC MNESIA ACTIVITIES NOT IN AND AN API MODULE WHICH THE WORK UNITS INTO MNESIA TRANSACTIONS WITH FUNCTIONS THAT LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE	
THINK BOTH STYLES HAVE THEIR THIS THINKING IS KIND OF CRIPPLING TO OUR COMMUNITY IN MY WORKED IN ARCHITECTURES THAT WERE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND IT WAS MY FAVORITE ARCHITECTURE IS FOR AT THE UI LEVEL AND AT THE FUNCTIONAL THIS ALSO ENCOURAGES A LANGUAGE BARRIER THAT ENFORCES THE SEPARATION OF UI AND BE A IT MAY BE SIMPLY THAT DYNAMIC LANGUAGES ALLOW THE DEVELOPER TO BE LAZIER AND TO GET THINGS DONE KNOWING LESS ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTALS OF WHETHER THIS IS A GOOD OR BAD THING IS UP TO THE READER	
THINK CUSTOM SERIALIZATION AND ISERIALIZABLE INTERFACE WILL BE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY IN YOUR CHECK OUT THE SAMPLE ALSO A GOOD DISCUSSION THREAD TOWARDS BOTH ISERIALIZABLE AND SERIALIZATION ATTRIBUTES WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A FULL CONTROL OVER THE FORMAT YOU SHOULD USE CUSTOM SERIALIZER AND IF YOU WANT RESPONDING THE FLOW THE ATTRIBUTES IS THE BEST

THINK SETTING THE DIRECTLY IS TREATED BY THE BROWSER THE SAME AS IT WOULD TREAT THE USER DIRECTLY ENTERING A NEW URL INTO THE LOCATION THIS MEANS THAT NO REFERRER SINCE REFERRERS ARE ABOUT ONE PAGE DIRECTLY REFERRING TO VIA A NOT THE BROWSER JUST GOING TO ANOTHER WAY I CAN SEE TO SOLVE YOUR ISSUE IS TO MAKE SURE YOUR DROP DOWN LIST IS IN A FORM THAT POSTS TO THEN MAKE YOUR JAVASCRIPT SUBMIT THE FORM LIKE THEN JUST NEED TO CHANGE YOUR SETDEFAULT ACTION IN YOUR CONTROLLER TO HAVE A PLAYERCHARACTERS PARAMETER SO THAT THE MVC WILL BIND THE REQUEST VALUE TO YOUR METHOD

THIS WEB SITE WHEN YOU SHRINK THE BROWSER WINDOW THE WHITE SPACE ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT DISAPPEAR FOLLOWING BY THE SHRINKING OF THE RIGHT FOLLOWED BY THE MAIN CONTAINER I HAVE RECENTLY STARTED TO USE MVC AND IN MY TEST CASE MY CONTAINERS DROP BELOW THE OTHER CONTAINERS AS I RESIZE THE BROWSER I AM USING A A PAGE WITH A CENTER AND RIGHT SECTION AS PART OF THE IT THERE AN ATTRIBUTE IN CSS THAT DICTATES THE BEHAVIOR OR AN HTML I HAVE VIEWED THE PAGE SOURCE OF THIS MAIN PAGE AND LOOKED AT THE CSS BUT NOTHING OBVIOUS HAS JUMPED OUT AT ME AS HOW THIS IS BEING IS THE MECHANISM THAT KEEPS VARIOUS SECTIONS ON PAGE FROM BEING REPOSITIONED WHEN BROWSER	
THIS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING THE CLOSEST I FOUND TO A BAKED	
THIS WHICH GIVES SOME INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW YOU CAN CONVERT A RPC WSDL TO A DOCUMENT I RECOMMEND TRYING THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE AN WSDL BY THE CONFORM TO JAXWS ONLY SUPPORTS SO ANY FRAMEWORK CXF OR WILL SUPPORT YOU CAN ALSO TRY TO CONVERT THE WSDL TO HAS A THAT COULD DO THE JOB FOR I RECOMMEND TRYING TO CONVERT THE WSDL TO A MORE RECENT THIS WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE BOTH FOR THE SERVER AND THE CLIENT I BELIEVE THAT IS WORTH FIGHTING WITH EVEN MANUALLY WRITING AND PARSING THE SOAP MESSAGES COULD BE	
THIS WHY MY ARRAY INITIALISED AS I WANT IT IS THE LOOP NOT DESIGNED TO DO OR AM I JUST NOT USING IT ARRAY NEW ARRAY ARRAY STILL FULL OF I I THIS LOOP	
THIS WILL NOT BE AS THE ONLY CODE IS THE RETRIEVAL WHAT YOU NEED TO DO ITEM IN BASIC IDEA IS TO ENCLOSE YOUR WORKING CODE WITHIN THE	
THIS WITHOUT VISUAL	
THIS WORK FOR I HAVE A SHAREPOINT INSTALL AVAILABLE TO TEST THIS IS FROM HYPERLINK	
THIS WOULD PARSE ALL THE IP ADDRESSES AND RECORD THEM IN A MY OR LOCAL OR MY ON PERL OR MY MY SPLIT NEXT UNLESS AND 0 OR OR CLOSE PRINT IP ADDRESSES IN ANY OF THE FOUND MY OR DIE OPEN MY CHOMP SAY CLOSE WOULD IF POSSIBLE USE BECAUSE IT GETS EVEN MY OR NEXT UNLESS OR PUSH CLOSE MY MY OR DIE OPEN MY CHOMP NEXT UNLESS OR SKIP LINE ON MY FOR MY PUSH SAY IF SAY NO MATCH FOR UNLESS CLOSE NO MATCH FOR	
THIS YOU LINE IN	
THOSE COOL NEW FEATURES WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED ON OTHER DATA STRUCTURES YOU WILL BE TRY TO AVOID OVERLOADING YOU CLASSES WITH USELESS KEEP THE CLUTTER TO	
THOSE I TEND TO MOVE THE METHOD TO A STATIC OR UTILS SO I BE MIXING THE CONCEPT OF THE WITH THE CONCEPT OF	
THOSE STARTDATE ENDDATE VARIABLES OF TYPE MAYBE THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT DATETIME VARIABLES CANNOT BE SET TO THEY ARE TRY SETTING THE PARAMETER TO AND HANDLE	
THOSE THINGS ARE STILL I DO A FAIR BIT OF THAT KIND OF OPTIMIZATION TO BE MOSTLY WRITING CODE THAT HAS TO DO RELATIVELY COMPLEX THINGS IN ABOUT 10MS ON AN IF WRITING CODE RUNNING ON MORE MODERN CPUS THEN THE BENEFITS BE AS YOU CARE ABOUT AND DOING A FAIR BIT OF THEN YOU MIGHT ALSO LOOK AT USING WHATEVER VECTOR OPERATIONS ARE AVAILABLE ON YOUR TARGET PLATFORM SSE ON ALTIVEC ON COMPILERS EASILY USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS WITHOUT A LOT OF AND THE INTRINSICS ARE PRETTY EASY TO USE THESE ANOTHER THING NOT MENTIONED IN THE DOCUMENT YOU LINKED TO IS POINTER YOU CAN SOMETIMES GET GOOD SPEED IMPROVEMENTS IF YOUR COMPILER HAS SUPPORT FOR SOME KIND OF OF THINKING ABOUT CACHE USAGE CAN BE REORGANIZING YOUR CODE AND DATA IN A WAY THAT MAKES GOOD USE OF THE CACHE CAN RESULT IN DRAMATIC SPEED INCREASES COMPARED TO OPTIMIZING AWAY THE ODD COPY OR UNROLLING A THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO ONLY OPTIMIZE CODE ACTUALLY MAKE SURE YOUR OPTIMIZATION ACTUALLY MAKES IT AND LOOK AT THE DISASSEMBLY TO SEE WHAT OPTIMIZATIONS THE COMPILER IS ALREADY DOING FOR YOU BEFORE YOU TRY TO IMPROVE	
THOUGH ALREADY CHOSEN AN I AM TYPING THIS ONE SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY YOUR PRIOR CODE DID NOT FUNCTION FIRES BEFORE IMAGES ARE USE VAR WIDTH VAR HEIGHT WHAT I THINK IT IS BETTER TO USE JQUERY FOR THIS TASK BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT

THOUGHT I REALLY UNDERSTOOD AND THE STANDARD JUST CONFIRMS MY OBVIOUSLY WRONG SO NOW I ASK FOLLOWING PROGRAM STRUCT INT STRUCT INT CHAR THIS LINE RETURN THE EXPRESSIONS AND ACCORDING TO MY INTERPRETATION OF THE ARRAY DEFINITION OF THE OPERATOR IS THAT IDENTICAL TO THIS HAS TYPE TO AND THE VALUE IS THE START ADDRESS OF THEREFORE EVALUATES TO AN INTEGER OBJECT WHOSE STORAGE IS AT THE SAME ADDRESS THAT AND FUNCTION WHEN IT IS THE OPERAND OF SIZEOF OPERATOR OR THE UNARY AN LVALUE THAT TYPE OF IS CONVERTED AN EXPRESSION WITH TYPE THAT POINTS TO THE ELEMENT OF THE ARRAY OBJECT AND IS AN HAS TYPE OF AND IS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE CONVERTED TO TO WITH THE ADDRESS OF THE FIRST ELEMENT AS THEREFORE EVALUATES TO AN INTEGER OBJECT WHOSE STORAGE IS AT THE SAME ADDRESS THAT THE FIRST ELEMENT IN THE STRUCTURE AND UNION POINTER TO A STRUCTURE SUITABLY POINTS TO INITIAL MEMBER AND VICE THERE MAY BE UNNAMED PADDING WITHIN STRUCTURE BUT NOT AT AS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE APPROPRIATE THE FIRST MEMBER OF IS THE THE START ADDRESS AND THE WHOLE OBJECT IS THE SAME AS DESCRIBED UNDERSTANDING WERE THEREFORE THAT EVALUATES INTEGER WHOSE STORAGE IS AT THE SAME ADDRESS THAT THE IN THE ARRAY AND THUS IS IDENTICAL TO THIS CANNOT BE THE BECAUSE THE PROGRAM CRASHES CYGWIN AND LINUX WITH GCC VERSIONS SO ANY ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE IS COMPLETELY OUT OF THE IS MY REASONING DO I NOT DO I DECLARE TO MAKE PTR POINT TO THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE VS ARRAY IN	
THOUGHT THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO GIVEN THAT RAILS HAS THIS NEWFANGLED NESTED FORMS BASICALLY I WANT TO CREATE OR UPDATE A USER AND ASSIGN THEM ROLES AT THE SAME SEEMS LIKE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT BUT I GET THE ERROR THESE PROTECTED EVEN TRIED CHANGING THE VIEW TO BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THE JOIN TABLE WAS CONFUSING ANY SUGGESTIONS ON HOW THIS SHOULD ACTUALLY USER FROM VIEW I TRIED AND FAILED TO GET TO GENERATE WHAT I WANT MAYBE MY FOR ROLE IN END COMING ACROSS SEEM TO BE A COMBINATION OF ME NOT USING NEEDING TO ACCESS AND THE FORM BEING SLIGHTLY DO END OBJECT CHECKBOXES EVEN WITH	
THOUGHT THIS WAS A PRETTY ELEGANT WAY TO DO AND THERE ARE WORSE WAYS TO GO THAN FOLLOWING JOHN FAR AS NAMESPACES AND I WOULD KEEP IT YOU WILL NOT RUN INTO A LOT OF COLLISIONS UNLESS TRYING TO CROWD INTO THE	
THOUGHTS FOR A FRAMEWORK LIKE SESSION OBJECT ON PAGE AND SET IT TO DEFAULT TO A THIS INITIALIZATION MAKE YOUR SESSION OBJECT TO LOOK FOR A SESSION IDENTIFIER A AND VALIDATE THAT ID AGAINST YOUR SESSION TRACKING BE IT DATABASE OR WHATEVER YOU ARE THE SESSION ID YOU GET YOUR RELEVANT USER ID WHICH YOU CAN THEN USE TO POPULATE THE USER CONTROL SHOULD JUST AUTHENTICATE THE USER FROM AND INITIALIZE THE SESSION BY BINDING SESSION ID AND USER ID ON THE BACK AND BY WRITING THE SESSION ID TO A A MORE EFFICIENT WOULD BE TO AUTHENTICATE THE USER ONCE AND WRITE THE USER ID TO A DIGITALLY SIGNED COOKIE SET BY THE AND TRUST ALL VALID COOKIES RETURNED BY THE THIS WOULD MAKE SESSION MANAGEMENT SO MUCH LIGHTER AND SAVE ROUND TRIPS DO

THREADING IN ANY BODY PROVIDE SOME GOOD CODES FOR MULTI THREADING IN TRIED ON GOOGLE BUT I NEED EXAMPLES WITH GOOD EXPLANATION ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING AT WHAT THAN ONE DO WE PERFORM MULTI THREADING APPLICATION IN	
THREADS MIGHT BE RUNNING ON DIFFERENT WITH DIFFERENT MEMORY THEY MIGHT BE RUNNING ON THE SAME WITH ONE INTERRUPTING THE THIS HAS TWO YOU HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER ONE THREAD WILL BE INTERRUPTED BY ANOTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF DOING SO IN YOUR NO WAY TO BE SURE THAT THREAD1 TRY TO READ THE STRING VALUE BEFORE THREAD2 HAS WRITTEN OR EVEN THAT WHEN THREAD1 READS IT IS IN A IF IT IS NOT IN A CONSISTENT THEN USING IT MIGHT DO WHEN YOU WRITE TO MEMORY IN ONE THERE IS NO TELLING IF OR WHEN CODE RUNNING IN ANOTHER THREAD WILL SEE THAT THE CHANGE MIGHT SIT IN THE CACHE OF THE WRITER THREAD AND NOT GET FLUSHED TO MAIN IT MIGHT GET FLUSHED TO MAIN MEMORY BUT NOT MAKE IT INTO THE CACHE OF THE READER PART OF THE CHANGE MIGHT MAKE IT AND PART OF IT WITHOUT LOCKS OTHER SYNCHRONIZATION MECHANISMS SUCH AS YOU HAVE NO WAY OF SAYING WHETHER SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN THREAD A WILL OCCUR OR SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN THREAD YOU ALSO HAVE NO WAY OF SAYING WHETHER OR WHEN CHANGES MADE IN THREAD A WILL BE IN THREAD USE OF LOCKING ENSURES THAT ALL CHANGES ARE FLUSHED THROUGH THE SO THAT CODE SEES MEMORY IN THE STATE YOU THINK IT SHOULD IT ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL WHETHER PARTICULAR BITS OF CODE CAN RUN SIMULTANEOUSLY INTERRUPT EACH THIS LOOKING AT YOUR CODE THE MINIMUM LOCKING YOU NEED IS TO HAVE A SYNCHRONISATION PRIMITIVE WHICH IS BY THE SECOND THREAD AFTER IT HAS WRITTEN THE AND ON BY THE FIRST THREAD BEFORE USING THAT THIS WOULD THEN GUARANTEE THAT THE FIRST THREAD SEES ANY CHANGES MADE BY THE SECOND ASSUMING THE SECOND THREAD STARTED UNTIL AFTER FIRSTFUNCTIONRUNFROMTHREAD1 HAS BEEN IF THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE THEN YOU NEED THE SAME DEAL WITH THREAD1 WRITING AND THREAD2 SIMPLEST WAY TO ACTUALLY DO THIS IS TO HAVE A MUTEX WHICH YOUR YOU DECIDE WHAT DATA AND ANY CODE WHICH READS OR WRITES THE DATA MUST BE HOLDING THE MUTEX WHILE IT DOES SO FIRST YOU THEN READ WRITE THE THEN THIS ENSURES CONSISTENT BUT ON ITS OWN IT DOES NOT ENSURE THAT THREAD2 WILL GET A CHANCE TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL IN BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT KIND OF MECHANISM WILL ALSO INCLUDE THE NECESSARY MEMORY SO IF YOU SEND A MESSAGE FROM THE WRITER THREAD TO THE READER MEANING FINISHED YOU CAN READ THEN THAT WILL BE CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT WAYS OF DOING CERTAIN IF THOSE PROVE TOO

WAS WAITING TO SEE IF YOU GOT AN ANSWER ON THIS ONE AS SOMETHING INTERESTED IN AS YOU TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW PROBABLY NOT SO USEFUL BUT IT MIGHT GET YOU USED SOMETHING BASED ON THE PORTAL IN A PREVIOUS PROJECT THERE ARE SOME LICENSE COSTS INVOLVED DEPENDING ON THE DEPLOYMENT SCENARIO AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE SLOW AND AND RATHER TRICKY TO CUSTOMISE THE DEFAULT FOR THE EXT TOOLSET IS FOR THE UI TO BE BUILT ENTIRELY FROM NOT FROM AND WHILE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO COERCE IT INTO WORKING ON TOP OF EXISTING IT SEEMED MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT NEEDED TO THAT IT WORKED WELL IN THE AND WITH THE PAID VERSION THE SUPPORT IS VERY ALSO IMPLEMENTED A WIDGET PORTAL SCREEN BASED ON WHICH WORKED REALLY WELL THE BASIC IMPLEMENTATION WAS VERY QUICK AND EASY BUT WRITING THE CODE TO SAVE AND LOAD PORTAL SETTINGS TOOK MORE TIME THAN I WOULD HAVE I WERE DOING A SIMILAR PROJECT I THINK EVALUATE IT LOOKS OK FROM A CURSORY GLANCE AND OPEN SOURCE BUILT WITH SO THE CORE SHOULD BE SOLID AND THE SLIGHTLY UNEVEN ANIMATIONS ON THE DEMO VERSION SHOULD BE EASY TO SORT OUT ASSUMING IT USES THE STANDARD SORTABLE IT HAS FUNCTIONALITY TO PORTAL SETTINGS TOO BY THE LOOKS OF SO IT SHOULD MEAN LESS HAND CODING THAT SIDE OF	
WAS WATCHING AND WAS THINKING IT MIGHT BE KIND OF FUN TO CREATE SOME COMPATIBLE WIDGETS THAT HAD SOME OF THE INTERACTIONS FOUND IN THE SOME OF THEM INVOLVE SOME FLUID HAS ANYONE TRIED USING OPENGL OR MAYBE QUARTZ COMPOSER TO CREATE WIDGETS SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND IN THAT DOES ANYONE KNOW IF IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE IN QUARTZ COMPOSER INSTEAD OF DROPPING DOWN TO THE OPENGL OR QUARTZCOMPOSER FOR CREATING OS X	
WAS WONDERING ABOUT THE BASIS OF THE QUESTION BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS EASY TO HOWEVER AS SOON AS YOU GO IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT ITS ACTUALLY A GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH THE FIRST THING ON THE PAGE IS THIS SPECIFICATION DEFINES THE FEATURES AND SYNTAX FOR THE EXTENSIBLE STYLESHEET LANGUAGE A LANGUAGE FOR EXPRESSING IT CONSISTS OF TWO LANGUAGE FOR TRANSFORMING XML VOCABULARY FOR BACK IN THE REAL XSLT IS ALSO WHAT MOST PEOPLE WILL ASSUME YOU MEAN BY IS A MEANS FOR TRANSFORMING XML DOCUMENTS INTO SOMETHING ELSE THAT SOMETHING ELSE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT BEING ANOTHER WELL STRUCTURED DOCUMENT PROBABLY ALSO FORMATTED AS XML USED XSLT TO RENDER XML TO CSV AND ON THE OTHER HAND IS ABOUT FORMATTING ABOUT LAYING OUT CONTENT ON A PAGE OR A SEQUENCE OF PAGES IN A FAIRLY STRICT ITS USEFUL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO MANAGE CONTENT THAT IS SPREAD ACROSS MULTIPLE ITS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO SPECIFY THE FORMAT OF A PAGE EVEN AND ODD INCLUDING ETC AND HAVE YOUR CONTENT FLOW INTO ONE WOULD THEREFORE TAKE A LOAD OF DATA AN XML FORMAT AND THEN USE XSLT TO CONVERT THAT DATA INTO A DOCUMENT CONSISTING OF THAT IN TURN IS RENDERED USING AN APPROPRIATE TOOL IN SAY PDF FOR PRINT OR OTHER MEANS OF USE CASE I HAVE IS TO TAKE A PILE OF TABULAR EXPORT THAT DATA AS RENDER THAT INTO AND FROM THERE TO PDF WHICH GOES TO A PRINTER WHO TURNS SAID PDF INTO A 500 PAGE ONE SPECIFIES IN THE THAT ONE WANTS PAGE PAGE BREAKS IN SPECIFIC THAT THERE IS A TABLE OF CONTENTS AND AN INDEX BASED ON PARTICULAR AND THE RENDERING PROCESS HANDLES FILLING IN THE PAGE NUMBERS ACROSS THE A BIT LESS CONFUSED

WAY ABOVE IS NOT THE WAY TO DO THE ELEMENTS ARE NODES AND SHOULD BE CREATED AND ADDED IN THAT REAL ND A1 A2 THE NODE NAME IS NOT GOOD TO USE WHAT IF THE NAMESPACE WHAT ABOUT SPECIAL WANT TO PROCESS THEM	
WAY I THE MEMORY ALLOCATION AND IS TO PASS IT OFF TO CUSTOM PASS THE CONTAINER AN LET IT WORRY ABOUT MALLOC AND WHEN I REMOVE THE OBJECT LET IT WORRY ABOUT THE OF COURSE THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU ARE ONLY STORING AN OBJECT IN ONE IF I HAVE OBJECT REFERENCES ALL OVER THE PLACE I WILL CREATE THE EQUIVALENT OF CONSTRUCTOR AND DESTRUCTOR METHODS WITH C VOID OBJECT I MEAN ANYTHING YOU WOULD POINT TO NOT	
WAY IS THE SEMANTICS OF BOTH ARE AGREE THOUGH SPLITTING MAKES DEBUGGING BUT SO DOES CONDITIONAL BREAKPOINTS A SIMPLE COMBINATION OF OR LONGER THAN 3 REFACTOR	
WAY IS TO GET THE BOX TO EXPORT IDEA OF WHETHER IT IS ACTIVE INTO YOUR FROM THERE YOU CAN PREDICATE ON THIS STATUS A RACE CONDITION AROUND AND ALERT ON MANY SYSTEMS BELIEVING THEY ARE OPTION IS TO MONITOR THE ACTIVE SYSTEM VIA A DNS ALIAS SOME OTHER METHOD TO ADDRESS THE ACTIVE AND PAGE ON THEN ALSO MONITOR ALL THE BOTH ACTIVE AND AND EMAIL ON THIS WILL CAUSE DUPLICATE ALERTS FOR THE ACTIVE BUT PROBABLY HARD TO BE MORE SPECIFIC WITHOUT KNOWING MORE ABOUT YOUR	
WAY IS TO HAVE THE GZIP TOOL DEPEND ON THE OUTPUT OF THE LOG FOR IF WE HAVE THIS C RETURN THIS SCONSTRUCT RUNNING WILL RUN THE NEEDED STEPS IN THE CORRECT HELLO IS NOT QUITE WHAT YOU BUT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS EXAMPLE AND YOUR REQUIREMENT IS THAT IS THE STEP THAT ACTUALLY CREATES THE ZIP SO THAT IS THE STEP THAT YOU HAVE TO ITS DEPENDENCIES THE PROGRAM THAT GENERATES THE CREATING THAT ARE AUTOMATICALLY YOU CAN NOW ADD THE ALIAS AS FOLLOWS TO GET THE DESIRED	
WAY IS TO SET UP ANOTHER OR A SCHEDULED THAT MONITORS THE SERVICES AND RESTARTS VALUE OF THIS APPROACH WOULD REALLY DEPEND ON THE NATURE OF YOUR SEEN THIS APPROACH USED TO KEEP A SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE SERVICE ALIVE WAS A LEGACY SYSTEM AND THE TEAM HAVE THE TIME TO REWRITE IT SO THEY USED THIS AS A	
WAY IS TO USE AND USE THE HEXADECIMAL FORMAT FOR THE RANDOM NEW COLOR

WAY OF DOING IT WORKS PRETTY	
WAY OF DOING THIS MAY BE TO USE MOCKING AND CHECK AN EXPECTATION THAT DISPOSE WAS CALLED USING VOID VAR DISPOSABLE D USE CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION TO PASS IN MOCK VAR CLASSUNDERTEST NEW DISPOSABLE THE METHOD NEEDS TO CREATE AND THEN DISPOSE OF THE THEN I WOULD USE AND INJECT A FACTORY CLASS THAT IS ABLE TO CREATE THE MOCK EXAMPLE BELOW USES STUB ON FACTORY AS NOT WHAT WE ARE TESTING FOR IN THIS VOID VAR FACTORY VAR DISPOSABLE F DISPOSABLE D USE CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION TO PASS IN MOCK VAR CLASSUNDERTEST NEW FACTORY	
WAY THAT SPRINGS TO MY MIND IS TO USE A GENERATION NUMBER FOR THE GIVE THE TODO TABLE A COLUMN CALLED GENERATION AND ASSOCIATE WITH IT A GLOBAL AND PERSISTENT GENERATION NUMBER BEST TO PUT THIS IN A TABLE IN THE TIME AN UPDATE OR INSERT IS MADE THE GENERATION NUMBER IS INCREMENTED AND PUT INTO THE GENERATION NUMBER COLUMN FOR THE UPDATED OR INSERTED THE RECORDS ARE FIRST READ FROM THE DB AND PUT ON THE WEB PAGE THE CURRENT GENERATION NUMBER IS ALSO RETRIEVED AND CACHED LOCALLY PUT INTO A JAVASCRIPT SUBSEQUENT AJAX DRIVEN READS USE A WHERE CLAUSE WHICH FILTER ONLY RECORDS WITH A GENERATION NUMBER GREATER THAN THE LOCALLY CACHED GENERATION THIS ENSURES ONLY NEW UPDATES AND DELETES ARE THE LOCALLY CACHED GENERATION NUMBER IS THEN ARE A BIT MORE ONE WAY TO DO IT IS TO TOMBSTONE DELETED RECORDS FOR A LIMITED SAY 21 YOU HAVE BIT COLUMN CALLED TOMBSTONE AND A DATETIME WHEN A RECORD IS DELETED THE COLUMN HAS GENERATION NUMBER SET IN THE SAME WAY AS FOR AN INSERT OR THE TOMBSTONE BIT IS AND THE DATETIME IS SET TO THE CURRENT TIME USING THE AJAX REQUEST CAN THEN SELECT RECORDS WITH THE TOMBSTONE FLAG SET AND REMOVE THEM FROM THE CLIENT SIDE IF THE CLIENT IS CODED SO THAT AFTER EVERY 20 MINS A FULL PAGE OR AN AJAX CALL THAT GETS EACH AND EVERY IS ENFORCED THEN A DB JOB CAN RUN EVERY MINUTE AND CLEAN UP THE TOMBSTONED RECORDS OLDER THAN 20 YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO SEPARATELY PERSIST THE GENERATION YOU CAN THE SQL FUNCTION MAX OVER THE GENERATION	
WAY TO ACCESS THE WINHTTP APIS FROM IS VIA THE WINDOWS SDK NAME FOR THE PLATFORM AND USING THOSE APIS YOU ARTICLE YOU LINKED TO SUGGESTS THAT INSTALLING THE SDK IS DIFFICULT THE GOOD NEWS IS ITS AN OLD ARTICLE FROM 2006 AND THINGS ARE MUCH EASIER THESE JUST DO THE THE LATEST SDK ISO IMAGE FROM WORRY ABOUT IT BEING CALLED THE FOR WINDOWS SERVER ALSO FOR SERVER XP AND TO THE ON THE SELECT FULL INSTALLATION AND LET IT RUN FOR HOUR OR GOTO START PROGRAMS MICROSOFT WINDOWS SDK VISUAL STUDIO REGISTRATION WINDOWS SDK WITH VISUAL STUDIO MAY EVEN BE PROMPTED TO RUN THE INTEGRATION TOOL DURING INSTALLATION BEEN A WHILE SINCE I INSTALLED IT SO I RECALL VISUAL COMPILER WILL THEN BE ABLE TO FIND AND IN THE APPROPRIATE AS USUAL THINGS ARE NEVER AS SIMPLE AS THEY SHOULD EMK HAS POINTED OUT THAT THE WINDOWS SDK CONFIGURATION TOOL WORK PROPERLY WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2008 AND CRASHES AFTER INSTALLING VISUAL STUDIO 2008 DETAILS AND WORKAROUNDS ARE REPORTED AND

WAY TO GET STARTED WITH THE FREE VMWARE PLAYER THE VMWARE ORACLE APPLIANCE THIS GETS YOU AN INSTALLED AND CONFIGURED DOWNLOAD THE CLIENT AND DEVELOPER TOOLS AND	
WAY TO HANDLE THIS VERY FLEXIBLY IS TO HAVE A BUILD DIRECTORY UNDER REVISION NOT TRY AND SVN YOUR ACTUAL HOME DIRECTORY HAS ITS OWN INSIDE THIS YOU KEEP A STRUCTURE THE MAKEFILE CAN CONTAIN LOGIC FOR SPECIALIZING FILES BE HEAVIER THAN YOU BUT IF YOUR ACTUAL SETUP IS COMPLEX DONE THIS ACROSS 3 OR 4 DIFFERENT UNICES AT A THEN WORTH DOING SOMETHING LIKE	
WAY TO PROGRAMMATICALLY THE IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE IS TO SIMPLY CALL THE ONCLICK EVENT HANDLER EXECUTE THE ICOMMAND ASSOCIATED WITH THE IF DOING THINGS IN THE MORE ARE YOU DOING ARE YOU DOING SOME SORT OF AUTOMATED FOR OR TRYING TO PERFORM THE SAME ACTION THAT THE BUTTON PERFORMS FROM A DIFFERENT SECTION OF	
WAY TO STOP IT IS TO USE THE BUT YOU WONT GET ANY FANCY MESSAGE IN THE SERVICE CONTROL MANAGER ABOUT AN ERROR OR A FAILURE TO CONTROLLER NEW	
WAY TO STRETCH IT TO THE SAME SIZE AS THE PARENT CONTAINER IS TO USE THE WILL MAKE THE TEXTBOX ELEMENT STRETCH HORIZONTALLY AND FILL ALL THE PARENT SPACE HORIZONTALLY IT DEPENDS ON THE PARENT PANEL USING BUT SHOULD WORK FOR MOST CAN ONLY BE USED WITH GRID CELL VALUES SO ANOTHER OPTION IS TO CREATE A GRID AND PUT YOUR TEXTBOX IN ONE OF THE CELLS WITH THE APPROPRIATE	
WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS PROBLEM IS EQUIVALENT EXTENDS THIS KNOWLEDGE WITH THE AND PUT IN SECTION FROM GENERICS AND GET AND PUT USE EXTENDS WILDCARD WHEN YOU ONLY VALUES OUT OF A USE WILDCARD WHEN YOU ONLY PUT VALUES A AND USE A WHEN YOU BOTH GET AND THE WILD CARD MAY START MAKING MORE	
WAY WOULD BE TO JUST PRINT IT AND THEN INVOKE A CODE	
WAY YOU DO THIS IN VS IS TO SET THE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS WHEN DEBUGGING TO MAYBE THE SAME WILL WORK IN CHECK BUT I HAVE IT ON THIS	
WAYS LEAD TO THIS IS IT IS VERY SO YOU CAN USE IT WITH BIG FORGET THE TRICK MAKE PHONENO UNIQUE AND USE TABLE IF EXISTS TABLE PHONENO FIRSTNAME LASTNAME INTO INSERT INTO INSERT INTO INSERT INTO INSERT INTO INSERT INTO TABLE IF EXISTS TABLE BKPHONE LIKE TABLE BKPHONE ADD UNIQUE IGNORE INTO BKPHONE SELECT FROM TABLE THE DATA TABLE ALREADY THEN YOU ONLY HAVE TO RUN A CREATE TABLE SELECT WITH A FOLLOWING INSERT IGNORE AT THE END YOU HAVE TO RUN SOME TABLE RENAMING WORKAROUND IS FASTER THEN A DELETE

WE HAVE A TABLE CREATED TABLE NOTES INTEGER PRIMARY KEY INSERT A USE INITIALVALUES NEW ROWID HOW TO SET THE COLUMN TO TO MAKE IT THE NOT THE RIGHT IT JUST SETS THE COLUMN TO TO INSERT A SQLITE RECORD WITH A DATETIME SET TO IN ANDROID	
WE NEED MORE BUT GUESSING HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE AS A CONNECTION STRING IN YOUR DBML DESIGNER AND IT MATCH YOUR PRODUCTION DB CONNECTION THIS IS THE THEN PERHAPS WRITE A CLASS THAT HANDLES ALL INSTANTIATIONS OF YOUR DATACONTEXT IN YOUR WITHIN THAT WHENEVER A NEW DATACONTEXT IS YOU OVERRIDE THE DBML CONNECTIONSTRING WITH YOUR CURRENT PROBABLY FROM YOUR THIS ENSURES YOUR LINQ STUFF IS ALWAYS CONNECTED TO THE CORRECT DB DURING SOMETHING LIKE THIS PROPERTY NAMES MIGHT SHARED FUNCTION AS DIM DCONTEXT AS DCONTEXT NEW RETURN

WEB PROBABLY DO NOT NEED THE BUT THE REMAINING LIST IS STILL QUITE	
WEB SERVER USUALLY RUNS AS A DIFFERENT USERID FROM SO YOU MAKE IT SO THAT A USERS FILES READABLE BY ANYBODY AND THE WEB SERVER READ WHY 744 IS A BETTER PERMISSION SET FOR FILES THE WEB SERVER NEEDS TO	
WEB SERVICE IS LOADED INTO PROCESS THAT IS RUN UNDER ASPNET YOU CAN ATTACH TO THIS PROCESS AND DEBUG GIVEN YOU HAVE THE SOURCES AND THE CODE IS COMPILED WITH DEBUG INFORMATION FILE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE UNC FILE SHARES GIVEN THEY HAVE PROPER ACCESS SINCE THE WEB SERVICE IS RUN UNDER A LOCAL USER YOU MAY HAVE HARD TIME SETTINGS ACCESS RESTRICTIONS ON THE FILE SERVER BECAUSE IT HAS NO IDEA OF HOW TO VALIDATE THE IN THIS CASE YOU CAN CREATE A APPLICATION FOR HOSTING YOUR COM COMPONENTS AND RUN IT UNDER A SEPARATE

WOULD CHOOSE THE CREATE AN OUTER CLASS AND NAME IT IF THE PARTICULAR CLASS IS USED IN A PUBLIC THE ONLY ARGUMENT FOR NOT INCLUDING IT OUTSIDE THE CLASS IS NAMESPACE THE INNER CLASS IS QUITE FRANKLY ANNOYING IN BECAUSE YOU MUST CONSTANTLY PREFIX THE TYPE NAME WITH THE NAME OF THE AS ONCE PUBLIC THE ONLY MOTIVATION FOR DONIG THIS IS REDUCTION OF NAMESPACE BUT IF YOUR NAMESPACE IS SO BIG THAT THE INVENTORYSAVEARGS CLASS IS MAKING IT TOO BIG YOU PROBABLY NEED TO BREAK UP YOUR NAMESPACE	
WOULD CONSIDER MIGRATING THE MS ACCESS PORTION TO MS SQL IS POSSIBLE BUT NOT SURE OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO THAT WOULD HANDLE A LOT OF THE MULTI USER ISSUES THAT MS ACCESS HAD FEW ISSUES CONVERTING OTHER MS ACCESS APPLICATIONS TO MS SQL END STAYS IN MS AND THE TABLES ARE LINKED TO THE MS SQL DB THROUGH SO LOW AND YOU GET THERE IS SOMETHING TECHNOLOGICAL THAT FORCES YOU TO USE MS THE EASIEST THING TO DO WOULD BE TO JUST CREATE AN ODBC LINK TO THE ORACLE TABLE THROUGH MS THAT WAY YOU ARE ONLY UPDATING IT ONE I ALSO QUESTION THE DECISION TO MOVE THE TABLE FROM ORACLE TO MS MORE TRUSTING OF ORACLE DBS RIGHT OFF THE START AND MS IS NOT KNOWN TO BE HIGHLY PERFORMING OVER ADD MORE MEMORY TO THE ORACLE GIVE IT A FASTER TIGHTEST BOTTLE NECK IS NOT GOING TO BE THE DATABASE GOING TO BE YOUR SO YOU ARE MOVING THE PROBLEM FROM ONE SERVER TO ANOTHER AND YOU ARE ADDING TO THE NETWORK CONGESTION BY HAVING TO SYNCHRONISE THE MS ACCESS TABLE WITH THE ORACLE	
WOULD CONSIDER USING A JAVASCRIPT TOOL THAT YOU CAN USE TO EMBED FLASH OBJECTS TO YOU IS SIMPLE TO USE AND HAS MANY VERY JUST USE FOR IF YOU NEED ANYTHING SPECIAL YOU HAVE TO STUDY A LOTS OF DEMOS ON THE SITE HOW TO CONFIGURE THE FLASHEMBED IS DESIGNED FOR FOR SCRIPTERS IN MIND WITH POLISHED PROGRAMMING API TOGETHER WITH A SUPPORT FOR JQUERY WHEN SUPPLYING CONFIGURATION FOR FLASH OBJECTS THE VALUES CAN BE COMPLEX JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS WITH FUNCTIONS AND OTHER THE PLUGIN WEIGHTS AROUND 5 KB WHEN YOU LIKE YOU COULD WRITE AN SERVER WHICH RENDERS THE HTML NEED ON THAT EXTERNAL SCRIPT RESOURCE LINK USING PER THE FLASHEBMED SCRIPT USING EVER Y FLASH YOU WANT TO EMBED ON A SOME USEFUL PROPERTIES LIKE NAME USE THE CONTROL IN YOUR PAGES THIS WAY FOR	
WOULD CREATE SOME TESTS AND RUN THEM ON THE RHEL SERVER TO SEE WHERE THE ISSUE I WOULD USE BUT CAN GET YOU THERE AS	
WOULD CREATE THE WHOLE ON THE SERVER AND INJECT IT INTO THE THAT APPROACH BYPASSES ANNOYING BROWSER AND REDUCES THE COMPLEXITY OF THE DID MENTION THAT YOU TRIED BUT IT FAILED IN I WOULD SUGGEST PERSEVERING IN GETTING IT TO POSTING ANOTHER QUESTION ASKING FOR HELP ON THAT OR EDITING YOUR QUESTION TO SHOW US WHAT YOU MADE THAT WORK IN	
WOULD DECLARE YOUR MAIN JQUERY SCRIPTS WITHIN THE MASTER AS YOU WOULD THEN ANY PAGE SPECIFIC JS FILES COULD BE LOADED WITHIN THE CONTENT CONTROLS THAT REFERENCE THE HEAD A BETTER OPTION WOULD BE TO LOOK INTO THE AND CONTROLS THESE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH A LOT MORE CONTROL OVER THE WAY YOUR JS FILES ARE SERVED TO THE YOU WOULD PLACE A SCRIPTMANAGER CONTROL IN YOU MASTER AND ADD A REFERENCE TO THE JQUERY CORE CODE IN IN YOUR PAGE THAT REQUIRES SOME CUSTOM JS OR A JQUERY YOU CAN SCRIPTMANAGER ALLOWS YOU TO DO THINGS LIKE CONTROL WHERE ON THE PAGE SCRIPTS ARE RENDERED WITH BETTER AFTER BY SETTING IT TO	
WOULD DEFINITELY FAVOUR THE 2ND APPROACH OF OVERLOADED FIRST APPROACH BLURS THE DEFINITION OF THE METHOD AS IT NO LONGER HAS A SINGLE THIS IN TURN INCREASES THE OF THE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR SOMEONE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT TO UNDERSTAND THE SECOND APPROACH EACH METHOD HAS A CLEAR EACH METHOD IS AND SOME ADDITIONAL CODE WHICH NEEDS TO BE DUPLICATED INTO BOTH THIS CAN BE OUT INTO A SEPARATE AND EACH OVERLOADED METHOD COULD CALL THIS EXTERNAL WOULD GO A STEP FURTHER AND EACH METHOD TO INDICATE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THIS WILL MAKE THE CODE MORE	
WOULD DEFINITELY TURN ANYTHING I CAN INTO STATIC FOR A DIFFERENT WHEN ARE CALLED WITHOUT A FOR THAT A 3 PARAMETER FUNCTION PUSHED WITH 4 PARAMS ON THE SAME FUNCTION COMPILED AS A STATIC FUNCTION WOULD GET CALLED WITH 3 CAN FREE UP REGISTERS FOR THE JIT AND CONSERVE STACK	
WOULD DEFINITELY USE MMAP FOR THE THIS WOULD MAKE IT EASY TO DIRECTLY ACCESS THE DATA AND FLUSH TO DISK WHEN THE ONLY THING YOU WOULD HAVE TO CONTROL IS WHERE THE FILE IS MAPPED IN THE ADDRESS SO YOU CAN MOVE IT POSSIBILITY FOR MEMORY MANAGEMENT IS TO CREATE A DIFFERENT FILE FOR EACH AND USE LEVEL DEFRAGMENTATION RATHER THAN IMPLEMENTING IT YOU NEVER MENTIONED WHAT YOU ARE BUT IF IT ALREADY HAS ONLINE DEFRAGMENTATION I WOULD USE IF YOU ARE USING LINUX AND CAN USE YOU CAN USE I WOULD EXPECT DEFRAGMENTATION TO BE HIGHLY OPTIMIZED AND IT WOULD TAKE A LOT LESS EFFORT THAN TO IMPLEMENT ON YOUR OWN IN ONE BIG	
WOULD DEPEND A LOT ON IF CERTAIN SITES NEED MORE RELIABILITY THAN WHAT YOUR EXPECTED LOAD PER SITE A POOL WILL BE MORE EFFICIENT IN BUT A SINGLE MISBEHAVING APPLICATION CAN MORE RAPIDLY CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR OTHER ADDITIONALLY YOU CAN RECYCLE OR UPDATE SEPARATE APP POOLS SEPARATELY WHICH MAY MAKE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES	
WOULD DITCH THE FUNCTION IN FAVOUR OF A FOR LOOP SINCE IT IS I WOULD ALSO ADD SOME WAITS USING THE BUT ONLY EVERY SO OFTEN AND ONLY IF YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR 5MS EACH TIME BECAUSE THEN PROCESSING 3500 RECORDS WOULD TAKE APPROX IS AN EXAMPLE USING A FOR LOOP THAT PROCESSES 100 RECORDS CAN TWEAK AT 5 MS INTERVALS WHICH GIVES A 175 MS XMLELEMENTS LENGTH INDEX PROCESS FOR INDEX VAR TOPROCESS PERFORM XML IF 1 LENGTH INDEX 100 WOULD ALSO BENCHMARK THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE XML PROCESSING TO SEE IF THERE IS A BOTTLENECK SOMEWHERE THAT MAY BE YOU CAN BENCHMARK IN FIREFOX USING PROFILER AND BY WRITING OUT TO THE CONSOLE LIKE START T NEW SOME XML TO NEW T THIS	
WOULD DO	
WOULD DO THIS SORT OF THING WITH A SO TO RECORD A MACRO FOR THEN YY TO YANK THE TO SWITCH P TO PASTE THE THEN BNEXT AGAIN TO SWITCH BACK TO THE ORIGINAL BUFFER THE LINE YOU STARTED THEN HIT Q TO STOP TO SWITCH PASTE THEN SWITCH YOU JUST NEED TO USE OR MAP IT TO A FUNCTION KEY JUST NOTICED IN THE COMMENTS YOU HAD MULTIPLE SO OBVIOUSLY YOU WOULD NEED TO RECORD YOUR MACRO	
WOULD GO EITHER WITH NUMBER 1 OR NUMBER IF YOU STORE THE TIME OF THE LAST UPDATE OF THE YOU COULD EVEN ASK ON EVERY REQUEST WHETHER THE DATE HAS BEEN	
WOULD GO FOR AS IT SOUNDS BETTER THAN	
WOULD GO WITH NUMBER YOU COULD EVEN MAKE A USER CONTROL THAT CALCULATES THE LINK AHEAD OF TIME AND CACHE IT PER USER TO REDUCE	
WOULD GO WITH TEXT BASED SO YOU CAN LOOK AT IT WITH ANY TEXT	
WOULD GO WITH THE TEXT FILE OPTION RATHER THAN IN THE YOU DO AS YOUR PROJECT YOU CAN UPDATE OTHER TOOLS THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT START TO USE ON YOUR PROJECT PHPUNDERCONSTROL OR A DEPLOYMENT TO BE ABLE TO THIS NUMBER WITHOUT HAVING TO RISK THOSE FILES TOUCHING REAL CODE AND POTENTIALLY CAUSING THIS ALL DEPENDS ON HOW YOU SEE YOUR PROJECT PROGRESSING AND WHETHER YOU THINK YOU WILL EVER USE ANY OTHER	
WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE SOME HELP ON ANYONE THAT HAS EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH RICH EDIT CONTROLS IN DELPHI THAT SUPPORT REGULAR EXPRESSION TOYED AROUND WITH V3 BASED CONTROLS ONLY TO FIND THAT USES SOME MS MICKEY MOUSE VARIANT OF REGULAR EXPRESSIONS FOR AND SO EXPRESSION SEARCHES AGAINST RETURN MISMATCHED SELSTART LOCATIONS DUE TO HIDDEN RTF GUESS THIS RULES OUT ANY BASED UNLESS SOMEONE COULD SUGGEST A ALSO HAD A LOOK AT RICH BUT AM WORRIED THAT THIS IS LONGER MAINTAINED OF THIS LOOKS IDEAL BUT CANNOT FIND ANY CONTACT INFORMATION TO ASK WHAT REGEX SYNTAX IS SUPPORTED OPTION WAS BUT THAT CHOCKED ON THE 2MB HTML FILE I TESTED IT EDITING WAS ALSO NON RESPONSIVE ON LARGE AS THE CONTROL LOOKED ANOTHER COMPONENT WAS BUT SADLY THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO SUPPORT SEARCHING USING REGULAR MY REQUIREMENT IS A DELPHI 7 CONTROL THAT ALLOW SIMPLE EDITING SELECTION AND MOST THE ABILITY THE SEARCH USING REGULAR EXPRESSIONS BUT NOT NOT TOO FUSSED WHAT THE UNDERLYING STORAGE MECHANISM HELP OR GREATLY EDIT DELPHI CONTROLS THAT SUPPORT REGEX	
WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING LIKE IF YOU MIND USING THE CALENDAR MONTH MONTH DAY DAY DAY MONTH CAN FIND HELP USING OR F AS SAID APROPOS WILL GIVE YOU A LIST OF FUNCTIONS RELATED TO SOMETHING AND EVEN BETTER PEOPLE ON WILL ANSWER ALL YOU THE QUESTION WAS A WHOLE NOT FIRST DAY OF EACH DEPENDS IF YOU READ OF

WOULD SOMEHOW USE FLASH THAT WOULD DRAW TO A THEN ENCODE THEM AS AN IMAGE THEN UPLOAD THEM TO YOUR A FEW MINUTES OF I FOUND HAS AN ACTIVEX	
WOULD SPECIFY THE DATABASE BY USING THE SYNTAX INNER JOIN ON	
WOULD SPEND WHATEVER TIME NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ALGORITHM ACTUALLY THEN TRY TO FIND OUT HOW SOLVE THE PROBLEM IF I COULD WHICH WOULD PROBABLY INVOLVE A NUMBER OF CLASSES THEN TRY TO INTRODUCE THESE CONCEPTS ONE BY ONE INTO THE EXISTING MAKING SURE TO GET PROPER TEST COVERAGE FOR EACH CONCEPT AS I INTRODUCE	
WOULD START WITH JAVA PERSISTENCE API A STARTER	
WOULD START WITH WAMP APACHE MYSQL AND TEACH YOURSELF PHP AND SOME BASIC WHILE LEARNING PHP YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT YOU CAN EASILY BUILD AND ALSO COMPLEMENT YOUR SCRIPTS WITH JAVASCRIPT FOR EXTRA FUNCTIONALITY AND ALSO CSS FOR THE DESIGN WILL NOTICE THAT ALL THE ABBREVATIONS I NOTICED HERE HAVE THEIR OWN SECTIONS AT I THINK THEY HAVE AN LEARNING CURVE THAN MANY OTHER AND IS A GOOD BASE OF LANGUAGES TO START WAMP OR LAMP U USE IS EASY TO INSTALL AS A BUNDLE FOR YOU GOOGLE AND AS IDE I RECOMMEND USING FOR EXAMPLE OR	
WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO USE VIM WITHIN AN IDE AND ECLIPSE THIS IS THE COMBINATION I USE AND IT WORKS VERY USED TO BE A VIM HOWEVER THE REFACTORING AND CODE ANALYSIS WITHIN A MODERN IDE WILL FAR SURPASS ANY CAPABILITIES THAT VIM WILL PROVIDE PLUGINS GET ME I LOVE VIM AND STILL USE IT FOR ALL SORTS OF MODERN IDES ARE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE ROUTE
