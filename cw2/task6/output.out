correct approach to handling tags depends on your preferences on processing You can either remove the invalid tags or try and clean the tags so they become approach to defining valid characters should be used in cleaning the input there is simply too many problematic characters to Note that the hyphen must be first or last in a character class to match instead of specifying a character set first approach removes invalid tags The first Ignoring invalid as if second approach tries to clean the The second Cleaning up the tag Remove Trim multiple white illegal characters with whitespace leads to for example the above is converted to the illegal characters entirely would result in more useful in some

it safe to assume that your application controls both the sending and the receiving of these pointers that the pointer be picked up by code that you the then I suggest you pass pointers at Keep the pointers in a hash or linked list associated with the script and pass an integer index into that data may feel like a high overhead the overhead is likely to be much lower than the overhead of using scripting within your so it probably will not be I see that you included the idea of using a missed the first time because tucked after the code But even for 1000s of this is not likely to be your performance
